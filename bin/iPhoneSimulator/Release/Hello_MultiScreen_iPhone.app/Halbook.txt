A tale of faith 

	What is faith? Faith occurs in several different ways. When a manager sees an employee with potential,
the manager trusts that person to do a good job. When a child trusts a parent to take care 
of them, the child puts his faith in that parent. So then is faith trust? Faith is simply a complete trust or 
confidence in someone or something. Knowledge of God in the face of hard times and putting faith
in Him are very different. People can say they know about God, or they believe in a God, but putting 
trust in God is not easy. Faith consists of Belief, to accept something is true, and accept a consent to recieve, according to the Oxford Dictionary.
Having faith doesn't mean we lose self-confidence, it just means we rely on God for our confidence and our identity in God.

	God says that we are created in His image. Is his image a physical image? Why didn't he make the animals in his image?
What makes us different from the animals? At first I was unsure,
but that wouldn't be possible as people have different genes that make them look different. The similarity would
have to be in the mind. But our mind is nothing compared to the ominous mind of God. So where does the similarity lie?
Possibly in choice. Humans have the will to make their own choices in the world. Humans can also tell the difference between
right and wrong, especially after a certain age. Does that make babies made in God's image? It seems possible that the animals are not
sinful, but they are living in a sinful world where bad things happen. In addition it is because we 
are in an imperfect world that we go through this life with torment. That type of explaination would make sense of all the chaos and evil around us.
Does that impact our choices?: depends. But if God is real, and 
God loves us, and he has given choice, we are free to choose faith, and choose love. 
I found two quotes from the Bible: Hebrews 11:6 "And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must
 believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him."
and John 3:16 "For God loved the world so much that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not die but have eternal life. 
For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in 
him shall not perish but have eternal life."

Accept God as your savior, accept Christ who died for your sins, and you may have eternal life with Christ!
