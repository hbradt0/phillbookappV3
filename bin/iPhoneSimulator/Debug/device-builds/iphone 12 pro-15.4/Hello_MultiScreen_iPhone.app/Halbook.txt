A tale of faith 

	What is faith? Faith occurs in several different ways. When a manager sees an employee with potential,
the manager trusts that person to do a good job. When a child trusts a parent to take care 
of them, the child puts his faith in that parent. So then is faith trust? Faith is simply a complete trust or 
confidence in someone or something. Knowledge of God in the face of hard times and putting faith
in Him are very different. People can say they know about God, or they believe in a God, but putting 
trust in God is not easy. Faith consists of Belief, to accept something is true, and accept a consent to recieve, according to the Oxford Dictionary.
Having faith doesn't mean we lose self-confidence, it just means we rely on God for our confidence and our identity in God.

	God says that we are created in His image. Is his image a physical image? Why didn't he make the animals in his image?
What makes us different from the animals? At first I was unsure,
but that wouldn't be possible as people have different genes that make them look different. The similarity would
have to be in the mind. But our mind is nothing compared to the ominous mind of God. So where does the similarity lie?
Possibly in choice. Humans have the will to make their own choices in the world. Humans can also tell the difference between
right and wrong, especially after a certain age. Does that make babies made in God's image? It seems possible that the animals are not
sinful, but they are living in a sinful world where bad things happen. In addition it is because we 
are in an imperfect world that we go through this life with torment. That type of explaination would make sense of all the chaos and evil around us.
Does that impact our choices?: depends. But if God is real, and 
God loves us, and he has given choice, we are free to choose faith, and choose love. 
I found two quotes from the Bible: Hebrews 11:6 "And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must
 believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him."
and John 3:16 "For God loved the world so much that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not die but have eternal life. 
For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in 
him shall not perish but have eternal life."

	I have a very hard time writing because I am far stronger in my left brain. Which leaves out the fact
that my right brain is not very creative. In school, I always had a hard time concentrating and thinking critically.
So writing this has been very hard for me in school and now. But the truth is, life has been far harder than writing any book or reading anything in school.
If anybody is looking for a story right now about a hero and a villian, this is no such story.
In fact, this story is more about people's choices and about God's grace. Jesus died for us and gave us salvation. God created
us as human beings with a choice of our own. Nobody in the book is a victim, hero, or a villian,
we all have choices and we all live by the rules of the world, but we don't have to belong to the 
world. In fact, we will have desires to gain wealth, power, beauty and other things for ourselves, or to have love in our lives, which are all
valid and honestly good things to have, so long as they don't surpass our need for faith.
The choice to love truly with agape love (unconditional love) today sets us free from the pressures of the world.
In retrospect, if my family and I hadn't experienced the life we had, I wouldn't be able to write
about experiences that I have seen, or gain the knowledge that I have gained in life. I wouldn't have the opportunity to
get married with a choice to consciously choose to love my spouse. And I don't regret it. But I'm not forcing anyone to convert to any religion, this is just thoughts and observations
on daily life from the point of view of a girl/woman living in a city during the 2000s era. When I wrote this, I am 24, during 2021. 

	Everyone has faced pain once or twice in their life. Physical pain, emotional pain, or a combination of both.
Pain is defined as suffering or discomfort caused by illness or injury, according to Oxford dictionary on Google.
In the past, humanity had a harder time treating illnesses or injuries. Less medication, less treatments, etc. Nowadays, we have vaccines to prevent disease,
doctors who are well trained, and medication that can alleviate pain and cure certain diseases or viruses. While things do look a lot better for us,
for some of us, life is still hard due to unforseen circumstances. My father, Dennis, had a very hard life growing up. Born to a mother that
had Paranoid Schitzophrenia, basically very mentally ill, near to Detroit Michigan in the 1960s. He had four siblings, of which he was the oldest, and a father that was often at work or 
inattentive, while his mother often supervised the children. When she wasn't neglecting them. Years later, after the parents were threatened to have their children taken away,
His mother tried to kill all four of her children, by placing one into a bathtub and trying to drown her. She then beat the others and smashed their heads into the floor. She locked them into a closet but
was caught. When caught, all four of her children were taken away from her and placed into the foster care system.

	Nobody could know except her what she had felt that day. Maybe it was a loss of control, the loss of her children. 
Maybe somewhere in her heart she had loved them, and wanted what was best for them, but the desire to keep them close outweighed any amount of agape love
for the children. Or perhaps, it was the her own pride that kept her from going and asking for help. Whatever the answer was, she didn't know it at the time, but her actions had 
caused a chain of events to happen that would hurt others all around her. All four of her children were placed into the foster care system. In the United States, this didn't sound so 
bad... except that they had been in a poorer area around Michigan, close to Detroit, one of the more dangerous cities in the United States.	
My father was the oldest child, but he had been powerless to choose which home he wanted to go to, he just had the option to stay in the home he was placed in. He was placed into the
care of a social worker, who would aid him in going to the places and seeing if he liked the home he was placed into. 

	Foster care in America is when a person takes care of children who are given to adoption. Often this can be because a parent cannot take care of their own child, or will
not take care of their child So they will give them to a pair of foster care parents (or even a single parent), who will gain a small amount of money for taking care of that child.
However, many foster care children are neglected by their parents, because people who do foster care often like the idea of the money. 
Sometimes foster care children, if they are very young, will feel at home with their parents, but some will wonder why their biological parents didn't want them or care for them. 
And sometimes, the parents would neglect the group of children in their homes.
My father said he couldn't remember much about the foster care homes, but that they were awful. Abuse happened to multiple children over the years, and sometimes, the children would abuse the other children.
A girl was raped by two older children in one house. My father said that a boy told him he would be killed with a shotgun if he ever told anyone anything.
"To an 8 year old kid, being told [that] is like a death sentence." Also, during the 1970s phones and the internet wasn't as feasible to use as now, so people
usually used landlines (which had been used generally by parents). In my father, a hope began to fester, that he would somehow make it out of there alive, but he would never tell anyone until years
later. In another home, the children were treated as dogs, and had to eat from bowls. He went to multiple homes in Michigan for the next few years. He was
eventually abused in the homes of people around the area, and developed a form of OCD, germophobia and fear of cracks, that would trouble him for most of his life.
Life wasn't all bad for him. He got adopted to a loving family in Wayne County, Michigan, and spent a lot of his older years there. But he made a lot of mistakes in his journey, and never felt truly at home with anyone.
It seemed the foster care system had good intentions. Giving children better homes than their previous home sounded very kind. But it wasn't. 
Several things today seem to start as good ideas. For example, loving who you choose is a good idea. But if you love someone who wants to kill you,
it's probably the best thing not to stay in that relationship. 

	To this day, nobody involved with the incidents that took place during that time ever faced a trial by the human court system fairly for what happened to him there. 
My father told me that his number one goal was to survive, not to worry about the superficial world as it was.
It wasn't bad to worry about life, or to have a goal, but during his life, he said it was hard to focus on 
anything about survival. When we asked him about revenge, he said that it wouldn't do him any good to seek revenge or to go out looking for justice.
Too many times, during our lives we try to play superheroes, but usually end up vigilantes that end up hurting themselves.
To start, he couldn't remeber much about the places, or the names of the people who hurt him. And to be honest, he said it was 
in some ways, better that way. After all, he had time to focus on the family who he had been given. An American (German and Italian) family with a husband, wife, and dogs,
and a stable home in Macomb County, Michigan.

	His adoptive parents were caring. They had been one of the nicer homes, and he decided to stay with them after
they had adopted him. When he first came into their home, and walked into the bedroom there had been
gift upon gifts in a pile. He got presents on the bed and his own room, and everyone treated him like family, well, most
of the time. Sometimes his father got drunk, and he had to avoid their father's anger. He and his sister (also adopted at a younger age), went to a local school in the area. They had friends to go places with, and things to do.
Each year they would go to the cottage for the weekends and come back to Wayne County during the days.
Most days, though a lot better than before, also had chores, but the family also had a few dogs as well. The mother Roberta, and father James, took care of their children. Sometimes, they went to 
their parents cottage nearby the Great Lakes. He decided he also liked engineering as a young man. So he learned how to program at the age of 12, and started taking apart and putting together devices. But that wasn't
the end to his troubles. He also had trouble telling his father things he had done. He once burned through a screen door, and too terrified to tell his parents anything, he ran away, and his sister as well, for 
different reasons. He felt like nobody would ever love him and so he did some of the things he did just to survive. 

	My father married his first wife, an Italian woman called Paula, when they were both just 21. They moved into a condo around the area with the savings inherited from his grandmother. With no
education he got a job and worked for a few years. Then after he became homeless, living with his sister and her dangerous boyfriend (at the time).
He married his second wife, my mother Vina, 5-6 years later in Michigan. Both he and my mother, went around the lakes, and had fun together in their first days.
Vina was from a merchant (business) family in India, that had raised her well. Growing up, she didn't have much things, but she had 7 siblings, and parents who loved her. Her parents were Indian,
also traditional, but they did work hard for their children. My mother was the only one who had come to America through a marriage, but ended up divorced due to circumstances out of her control,
and the man ended up leaving her. 
Seduced by the thought of the American Dream, my mother put her heart into working, though in the university, she wanted a better life for herself. She thought that America had more freedoms
than India had, where women could make money, and do things for themselves like marry who they love. 
Both my mother and my father lived in Michigan during that time. The new family was Christian, the mother worked at a bakery, and his father was in insurance. His father's father had died at a young age, and his father had a very traditional
view on life. His father told him to take care of his wife when he married her. They both also went to Wayne State, a University, in Michigan, later getting his degree in Electrical Engineering.
He then got a job in Arizona, and then California. With California we lived with my mother. She also had mental illnesses. They ended up getting 
badly separated in California. He lives in a 1 bedroom apartment with my brother and I for the last few years, because California has become very expensive.

	Imagine a messy car accident on the side of a highway. Two cars, engines, and parts thrown everywhere, nobody is dead but there are injuries. 
And worse the stream of blood from wounds that may not sometimes heal, or may take a while to heal. What nobody tends to realize is the physical pain, though can hurt more at the time, 
lasts for a shorter amount of time than mental pain. Divorce is referred to the messy and painful end of a marriage. Though not as painful as a car accident 
it does leave an impact. Separation refers to two people being separated (often physically). Separation can also leave an impact.
 My father was divorced once and separated once. He, my brother and I lived in a 1  bedroom apartment and had a hard time paying for bills due to the second separation. 
My father also taught me that happiness comes from choices we make to be happy. He knew that he wasn't perfect and makes mistakes too in life, like sometimes not listening 
to his wife. The key to a good marriage is communication, trust in God, and the choice to stay with each other. It's not about the feeling if being in love. 
Both his wives refused to listen, and instead used him as a means to an end. As a person we aren't defined by the divorce. We have choices and free will and the choice to love. 

Doug and his divorce
	Years before my father had a bad divorce, My mother, father and I met a family friend called Doug every sunday through a church outreach. I was in college.
Doug, who was roughly middle aged. Doug was a very nice man, but he was also depressed.
He and his wife had a terrible divorce and she took all three of his children. She also took a lot of spousal support. Ironically, she also had 
very rich parents and so the children had been well taken care of. However, Doug had to live on his own renting a room. And this would be
the rest of his life due to the American family court system. He couldn't change it, unless he was remarried, and to remarry 
requires him to start dating another person, someone who he would try to trust, but trust is difficult. Marriage requires two people to make it work,
and despite the fact that he might try the rest of his life, he couldn't guarantee that his next wife would do the same.
Sometimes Doug said that life wasn't worth living because it felt too painful to not have his family together. I spent time with him, around
a year or so. Doug was a good man, every day we could see him trying to change and be more positive, but then he felt something happen,
and his mood would shift into the depressed man he identified as. Doug warned us then, and it had been like he had known what would happen to my father
years before my father got his divorce.

	I couldn't get Doug out of my head the few months after my parents had been divorced. I had known a relatively abnormal upbringing, but to me life had always 
seemed normal. My parents rarely slept in the same room when we were around, and rarely hugged each other. They had both 
seemed independant. They would tell us in the past that they were in a new era (the 2000s, and the old-fashioned things of the past didn't have to 
be there to be married). But then again, they would always fight. I remember during Elementary and middle school, neither person wanted to take us to school,
and eventually my father would end up taking us both to school right before work. They both took turns giving us lunches, but
more often than not our mother would give us lunches. Hot pockets and peanut butter sandwiches (which is actually tedious to make every single day). 
Sometimes, it was better to go with him then our mother, who 
would sometimes yell at us in the car for getting late. Sometimes, it seemed that they both wanted to escape their realities (my mother through finances, my father through gaming and television,
during the night). They had ambitions and a taste for a different life. Sometimes he neglected my mother, and she had to plan trips
and do things with us on her own. 

	I was born biracial, half Indian (from India) and part British on my mother's side and half German or Italian on my father's side, nobody was really sure of which ancestry. 
I looked more Indian than I did white, and had a medium tan skin.
In some states, in some parts of the world, beauty is judged upon skin color, but in the US, having that type of skin hurt more because I felt isolated from my dad. 
To be fair, America is very liberal with beauty standards, and most families will tend to look past the color of one's skin. But I tried to not see myself as a color, rather as a person. 
My brother was the same way. I lived in Michigan as a baby, Arizona as a toddler,
and California when I grew up. My brother was born in Arizona. We had no family living close to us, and not many friends, other than my mom's new "mom" friends, who also 
had children of their own. Life was kinda tough as a child, because my parents didn't have much support in the community, and didn't go to organizations, or anything, regularly. Because they 
had different faith, they couldn't seem to agree on which to do. Sometimes, they would take us to Churches, and other times to a Temple. Sometimes they took us to activities, like 
acting school. Long story short, the acting school turned out to be a scam, and the parents of children paid a lot of money for their children to get agents that would rarely end up
getting them jobs. We did a few after school activities, like Tae Kwon Do and Dance, but that had to end when my father was sentenced in court to pay more child support than he
had been paying before. He had another child, to another woman, from his past marriage. And that only put more strain on the family. In addition, with my mother always going to our schools,
and volunteering because she had nothing to do, she ended up picking fights with teachers. She felt like she couldn't work because we were in school and she had to raise us, and she 
couldn't trust my father. As a result, I ended up being disliked by everyone. Additionally, I looked different than others, so I ended up being picked on, and as the test (her first) child,
had a very interesting life. 

	But is every little thing our own fault? We weren't old enough to tell when she criticized him for every little thing he did, whether the punishment justified the crime.
I met a young man once years later who asked about punishment and crime. He said it was too easy for people to get away with sinning if they just said they were saved with God's name.
But then again, who is truly saved. Multiple times, the Bible writes about false teachers, those who teach and their fruits do not match what they 
teach to the people. But it is a struggle sometimes, because it seems like the people who are perpetuating the lies and deceit that everyone can sin freely is foolish. Ironically this 
mindset will also tend to hurt us, because sin isn't without consequences. People who murder will face the wrath of God and often the system (or human law), in which they are usually
either sentenced for life (or multiple years in jail), or even killed. The people who truly repented and believed, would do their best to try to stay away from sin. Paul, Peter, and a few
of the apostales went out preaching the word of God, Jesus and had their own lives taken from them. Despite the fact Paul had killed Christians, he was beaten, stoned, and had other hardships
for his faith. The way to tell a true believer is one that produces fruit, that tries to love God and love others to the best of their ability.
If we focus on the sins of the past, they tend to become dwelling places for our mind to inhabit.

	There's an old saying: we only grow smart enough to know that we don't know anything. 
Faith itself, is not purely based off of knowledge, but rather of choice. Faith itself knows no bounds. My father was able to make his own decisions, even despite his hardships. But he realized that
faith itself was a choice. Happy, why was everyone so happy in the midst of a family tragedy?
My parents said that most people wouldn't help them out. They couldn't count on anyone but themselves.
They had problems with trust. If the world knew those things, that to be content (maybe not happy)
but my father learned over time that being joyful was a choice, to love was a choice. I think in some ways my mother did as well.
Maybe people wouldn't keep running after the things we think feel good (like relationships, lust, drugs, etc.), if 
we knew that contentment was simply our choice to trust. And the best part of this is that we don't have to 
do it alone, but also that requires a choice to trust! 

	As iron sharpens iron, brother sharpens brother. The first time I heard that phrase was watching the cartoon Ninjago. 
It was season 5, and there was an episode where the lego figure of the master tells his disciples
to stick together. And this often occurs in life as well. Marriage, a union of two people, is in our culture, and is everywhere.
People spend a lot of money on weddings. Teamwork also occurs in projects, and even during friendship. 
The teamwork we had learned at Saddleback Community College helped me get a job. At Saddleback we had done multiple projects with other students. 
We also learned leadership. Prior to my new job, I had worked at McDonalds for a few years, where there had been a small hierarchy. Managers had been
able to place people and take care of balancing drawers. Crew members would each take care of their own area. The work at McDonalds had been
tedious, but also a different type of work. Sometimes, at McDonalds we would also have teamwork, but mostly it had been regulated by someone above us.
At the new job, it had been more about working together to get a job done. We also have a saying: 2 minds are better than one. This is also in the Bible, in Ephesians: Two are better than one, and can help each other succeed. In fact, this
mindset is a mindset of teamwork, as old as time. At the new job, teamwork was encouraged, and sometimes, it has been even encouraged
during life.

	By working for something, you will learn the value of it and not take it for granted.
Sometimes just because we had to work for it doesn't mean that it's a bad thing. And sometimes, it shows our character, 
to rise above the hurt, and work like we would work for something greater than ourselves. Each time we try to minimize the work or 
the toil of someone, we are only looking for an easy way out. And most of the time, the easy solution will not work.
Every once in a while, there will be the one person who doesn't commit to do work, and just goes along for the ride!
There had been times where we needed to do extra work, at college and at school. At first, one will feel angry.
When I saw how unfairly the court treatment had treated my father and my mother, I had felt angry. I remember the emotions
riding me like a wave. During that time I couldn't shake off the emotions, because it felt like everything that I had believed,
that the world would right itself eventually, was gone. 

	Terrible things happen every day - in the world. What about bad things in the world, like people, especially children being killed or murdered occurs, it is normal
for people to feel grief and anger. Our first instinct is to attack. A man in West Virginia was beaten for being 
in the wrong place at the wrong time. Two other young men attacked him in the middle of the night, one punching him,
the other kicking him in the head. His name was Ryan Diviney, and (a lot of people who already know this story) he 
ended up going into a vegitative state at the time. He lived in that state for 10 years and his father stayed at home
to take care of him. Where was God during his life? It's hard to look up that story and think, what if that had been me?
Because it's normal, human, to put ourselves into another's shoes. Humans even personalize animals, making them human with human characteristics. 
To start historical evidence: The strongest of which being the disciples testimonies, the fact that Jesus chose
to die for us, and other pieces of evidence strengthen the knowledge of God.

	I met a young boy in school years ago, who tried to do good, in a journalism class, with a few others. This boy cared for his friends, had fun, and knew right from
wrong (and sin from good fruit). He was Jewish. There was so many things that I did, and others had done to him, and to others by accident, and sometimes to be cool
or to make friends and we had done it wrongly. And so many times, this kid lived his life honestly. He wasn't perfect.
Then one day he went out with a friend years later. There had been a search out for him for days. It seemed he had ran away after hanging out with his friend.
They looked for a few weeks. And one day there was rain, and the rain loosened the soil around his body, found in Borrego park. 
As it turns out, the young man thought he was doing the right thing, and he tried to kiss the his friend. He thought it was love. Love, something sincere,
something which feels right. But that form of love, wasn't true love. Because the other young man took out his knife and killed him.
After speaking to the young man's parents online, I joined a group, Blaze it Forward. Blaze's life meant something.
His parents showed true mercy, when they told people to show kind acts, to give his life meaning. That in itself is extremely hard to do. It's easy to say we are ok when
everything seems normal, simple, natural. But when there is actual pain, of something that happens that is unfair, what do we do.
Their example shows the true capability of humanity, when we are hurt, we can still rebound and choose to forgive. And forgiveness is powerful. 
Rather than strive for revenge on the man who killed him, they mourned and channeled their energy into helping the world. 

	To those who have mourned out there these feelings are understandable, but we cannot live with them.
	In my own experience, I felt angry about how life was just so unfair that children could be hurt, and to not deal with it, I tried to escape. Death itself became a reality in my mind.
I don't know how long I have to live. Sometimes, that tends to put pressure on me to live for now, to do everything today so that tomorrow,
I don't have to worry about what I have to do. Carpe diem. With this mindset, I ate what I wanted, went out and made friends, started dating, and lived for the moment.
Emotions then took over, worry about the future gone, I just wanted to feel good, so that everything would be right and ok. Sometimes I cried as if it had been
my last day on earth, and I would never see my loved ones again. The worry about not knowing hits us hard.The sheer unfairness astounded me as a young woman. I just couldn't understand how anyone could justify murder.
It was like there was no choice, we had to accept that we are all going to die. Then comes the worry about purpose in life. 

The one thing I had ever done right in living was
	He told me about his years at the cottage in Michigan. 

I don't fully know the answers to some of my questions, so I decided to seek out answers from people who have experienced various types of situations in 
the world. I had met plenty of homeless in the past, but had never truly seen the need for Christ so great as in these people.
When people say they'd rather be happy than rich, well these people didn't seem to have gotten the memo. A man in a red trenchcoat by the train station at
8 am in the morning at San Clemente. Right by the train, we were so cold. But the cold didn't seem to bother them. I met a guy by the name of SJ. SJ, who had a 
pet dog with him but the dog hadn't been washed for months, and shivered out in the cold beach air. The faith of the dog stood out. She kept watch over him,
she jumped in front of him as she assumed he was going to be hurt as the train flew past us.
The leaders of the bible study worked hard each day, going to
them and ministering to the homeless, and feeding them oatmeal. SJ told me what brought him there, it was a surfboard-making job that eventually went down
the drain with drugs. Perhaps the reason lies between a more complicated context. 

Some people have been brought up using drugs because they have seen peers or adults use drugs around them. Others start doing drugs by choice. 
Eventually they are addicted, and they begin to look to the drug for salvation. How many times have we seen this before? Addictions can come in 
all forms of media, entertainment, a look, money, beauty, fame, etc. Drugs have an added side effect as well, they also make the person crave the drug. 
In most addictions, it is hard for a person to change once it has become a habit. To break down a person's faith is hard, but to create a faith is often harder.
Some people say faith is like a house. It needs to start with a strong foundation, or else it will collapse. I didn't know what a foundation was so 
I googled it up: According to oxford: A foundation is the lowest load bearing part of a building, typically below ground level.

My mom is from Gujarat in India. Going on a plane the first time I ever tried was incredibly scary. My first time, I was 
five years old travelling to a village in India with my mother and brother who was three. The flight itself took around 
16 hours of total time. I remember as the plane first took off and the engines began to roar. There was that moment of initial
shock and paralyzing fear, when the sense of gravity fell away and I felt as if I had become weightless. I don't remember
much after. My mother decided to also take chewing gum along with us to drown out the roar of the plane so we chewed as hard
as we could trusting her as only a child could. She herself trusted the gum, and the plane that she wouldn't die before 
making it to Gujarat. The year was 2002, and planes had become relatively safe to travel on... but that didn't prepare us for the 
other differences between India and Southern California. 
Upon arriving at Bombay, I saw what I had not seen before. There was hundreds of people at the airport and hundreds at
the train station. We were going from Bombay to Surendranagar in Gujarat. The train was so full, 
people had to squeeze in while entering, and a few were almost outside the train. I saw people everywhere, by the sides of the 
road, some in rivers. When we got off the train, I saw people outside in Rickshaws (a 3 wheeled car).

In Surendranagar, the days were always warm, and so were many nights so long ago. 

In Gujarat, the sweltering heat made everything very dry. The village was very colorful, and had multiple markets
on the streets. But when we got to my mother's second family home, there was no running water, no toilet paper,
buttermilk took a mile to walk to and buy, people were on the street everywhere and there was a lot of manure,
often people had a communal wellhouse (This was in 2002). 
The people were happy despite everything. One could still see they had the capacity of faith. They trusted the 
environment and lived with the environment. People are going to be human, even if they don't have the full knowledge of God but they have the capacity for faith.
We are made in God's image.

The Caste system:
I spent three long, harsh months in India, 2 in Surendranagar. Most days, I spent with a young teenager of a servant
(in America a servant is a housemaid) and my brother. Surendranagar was lonely, and we had no shoes, so we often
explored the surrounding areas. With the glass on the street, the young man showed us how to bind our feet with moccassins. 
My mother brought us shoes once she saw our feet, but the others didn't use shoes, so I wanted to be like them. She said
their feet had gotten used to the glass. This glass hadn't just been regular glass, however. This was a sharp type of glass, from broken bottles that had been trampled
over by the masses of people and animals travelling through the area during that time.

The class system in India (caste system) has been a problem in India for a long time. The caste system was an old practice of keeping one in a series of classes, or castes based upon their birth.
Since one of the Hindu beliefs is that people go through multiple lives, including animal, and the better (or larger/more human) a person is, the better
they have been in a past life. Due to this belief, the Caste System was born, and so people had to stay in their "class," marry in their class, etc. 
In Europe, a similar sort of belief occurred. During the 1800s and prior, people were set in a class society, and they couldn't move out of their class.
Meaning, no matter how hard someone tried to be successful, if they were born in a lower class, they could never join the upper classes.
This idea caused people to turn against each other many times in history. Communism, the idea that everyone should have the same thing, was a response to
the human set of classes that we belong to. Communism failed in Russia due to the fact that the people on top had a lot of power, and they abused their
power. But in a sense, the class system, to an extent, still survived today. 

Today's world, the class system still occurs in certain areas. The people neglect the homeless and the poor here in America for multiple reasons.
Some is because they believe the people are lazy, or have mental issues (and some would be correct in this assumption). In addition, others believe that the homeless are on
drugs. But collectively, the homeless, are each individual people, each with different needs and different situations that caused them to end up 
where they are at today. And if we took off the label of being homeless (or said it was only temporary), that would give a whole new perspective on the 
idea of being homeless. 

Another interesting example of how humans are made in God's image:
Mahatma Gandhi tried to abolish the caste system when he fought for Indian freedom. The nonviolence movement has been regarded as one 
of the strongest forces during all of time. It produced peace between the British and the Indians. In addition, this movement was later used in 
Martin Luther King Jr's fight for American freedom and the end of segregation. But the caste system remained a problem in India because 
many didn't want to see the end of old traditions.

The Jewish people seemed to have similar traditions that others didn't want to see ended. For example, faith over good works. During the old
testament, people had a lot more traditions to live with. Circumcision, etc. Also the Jewish people had to follow duties, to take
care of their people. In Jewish culture, there was no such thing as buying another home, wives lived with men's families, and sons with
their fathers. Jewish people would take care of their fathers and mothers and would get an inheritance. So wisdom, knowledge, and
sometimes wealth would pass on through the family. In California, before my parents got separated, we lived with my mother. They ended up getting 
badly separated in California. He, even today, lives in a 1 bedroom apartment with my brother and I for the last few years, because California has become very expensive.
And the past year, the pandemic had added even more pressure to his daily duties. I say these things not to make someone feel sorry for anyone, but
rather to inform from experience.

When I was a kid, I remember the hard times were a thing. Sometimes the hard times could be losing a loved one, job loss, illness, poverty as well.
The good times could be a thing as well, including marriages, birthdays, job promotions, completing school, etc. But as a child,
it always seemed normal to have the hard times. It was typically to feel like we didn't have enough (or as much as others had).
My father and mother both had prior marriages, and my mother was unemployed for around 15 years. They had no businesses and few assets.
In fact, they didn't know how to "do business," so my mother always was running around trying to "do business" or get a job.
She tried playing the stock market, and other things in her spare time. And during that time, my father had to pay his ex-wife 
child support. So we spent days cutting coupons, and we couldn't spend too much money on vacations. On top of that my mother felt like it was nearly impossible for
her to get a job, so she felt like the world was against her. In addition, she enrolled us into activities where they had to pay a lot of money a month for,
so that also took away from my dad's income. They were impatient in some ways, and rash because each of their individual pasts had prepared themselves for pain (unconsciously),
and that was all they could see in their future. And as a result they fought a ton. 
In the future, I would end up taking their path in some ways because I acted on that fear of losing everything too fast.
Anyone who says they need something other than God, water, safety, food, shelter, and basic essential needs is lying to themselves.
We didn't know what the future would hold, maybe something better or something worse could be coming. But instead of accepting the future as 
an unknown we made mistakes and that caused our journey. That day I didn't know that mistakes could make us stronger.

Take Peter for instance in the Bible. Peter denied Christ 3 times when Christ was arrested and Peter had been a disciple with
Christ for a long time before. Peter had seen Christ perform miracles, but had still denied knowing Christ at all. What had happened there?
After Christ's resurrection, I think Peter would have wanted to be able to go back in the past and say that he did know
Christ, but he couldn't go back in time then. Peter didn't let that stop him. The disciples had gone through incredible amounts
of pain, but they knew what they were fighting for. And even though they made mistakes, they ended up following Christ still even
after because they realized that their God was stronger than who they were by themselves.

I wasn't a Christian growing up, and I was very unpopular at school during my school years.
There were nights where I felt empty, lonely, and had no way to take it out of my life. I felt sick, had trouble sleeping,
and often worried about death. My brother Riley once asked our parents what happens to people when they die, but got two
different answers. From my mother, it was we go to the earth, and into nothing, and from our father, it was if we chose to believe in Christ,
then we would go to heaven. But our mother always criticized the Church, because the missionaries in the past seemed to take away people's rights,
under the guise of Christianity. We always questioned God, wondered if science proved God didn't exist.
One night, I felt my chest start to ache, and worried if I would die, because I didn't know
where I would go. I decided to say that I believed in Christ and he died for my sins, and Riley decided to keep his 
eyes open for the future.

When I was eighteen years old, and didn't have my drivers license due to many failed test attempts, I waited at the Saddleback bus station at the college to go home.
And one day, a girl came up to me and invited me to ask questions. Her name was Lexi, and she was a disciple for a local Christian program.
She gave me a small piece of paper, and said they were answering questions and doing a study about the Bible.
At this time, I said I was half-Christian, because I didn't know enough about the bible. I hadn't ever read the Bible, only listened to KWave, the local Christian radio station.
The closest I had ever gotten to know God was that science didn't prove He existed, yet science couldn't prove He didn't exist at all. So I was fully agnostic at the time.
But even agnostics question their circumstances, different from atheists, who have a faith that God does not exist. When I followed her to the building at the back,
the Student Center, and went to the tiny room on the second floor, and they started to read a passage in the Bible. People began to say, praise God and amen.
That time I looked at them kinda funny, because I didn't understand why they would say that at every line, at first, it seemed to me like overkill. And I had so many questions,
like how could they for sure know God existed. What about Noah's flood, and the lack of geological evidence for it - Depending on who you speak to?

One of the girls there, Cassie, had an interesting answer, she said that "If we cannot see love, how do we know it exists?" I wondered about that... some people
said it is a chemical in the human brain. But some people will say it is a choice of will to show we love someone, perhaps an electrical impulse. But how do we know what 
love is? We cannot simply add love by adding "dopamine" to our brain, because dopamine will only give us a short dose of the happy chemical. 
Testosterone and estrogen drive lust; dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin create attraction; and oxytocin and vasopressin mediate attachment.

At Saddleback College, when I first started and decided to take Computer Science, I met the Saddleback Christian Students.
I asked them questions for 3-6 months, and couldn't wrap my head around the evolution/creation issue. However, it wasn't as compelling
as the disciples evidence. I couldn't just choose to follow that God, so I also looked into other cultures and religions to try to find God.
Once I looked into the concept of faith and sin, I finally accepted a loving God, because it seemed the most plausible. But the question of why the world was so 
cruel would always linger in my mind. I chose to follow God at the age of 18. But 6 months later, and I had found that living was a lot harder than I thought.
I also started studying at college, and was rash at the time, so I thought everything should just happen fast. At Saddleback, the kids made fun of my weight,
and I had no friends in the same areas. The Christians were kind, but sometimes, I felt like I just didn't belong.

My mother also left our father for months and would come back every few months. She was on and off for jobs, both local and in the bay area. 
She came back some nights very late and would scream at my father for not caring about her. In some ways, she was jealous of his stability,
and she felt insecure about her own ability to get a job. I followed both of their paths and decided to go into computer programming.
Saddleback College also had a transfer guarantee program to the UCs. It was very easy to get into, and the next year, I was able to transfer into 
one of the UCs close to us. However, the cost of tuition was very high compared to the community colleges, and coupled with the events the future
had, life could only get worse.

At the age of 20, my parents got separated, and I had to go back to work to pay for college. 
I didn't want to blame God or follow God at that time for what had happened to me, but I didn't know whether it was in His plan or not. Sometimes I asked him why had 
all this stuff changed for me at once. Why had I brought my father back that one day after my mother kicked him out? Why did I want everyone to be 
a happy family when they clearly didn't want to get along?
I remember the day I first moved into that apartment in Laguna Hills. I had lived in Laguna Hills for a while then, just moved to a different location.
The soft brownish walls, and slightly soft darker brown floor reminded me of an office. Alltogether, the place consisted of two rooms and a single bathroom.
I was twenty years old and it had been my first year going to a new school, UCI, after transferring from a local community college. It had come out of the 
blue, like lightning. "You, and your dad, and your brother cannot live here anymore. We sold the place. We may get another" From my mother.
 That night was the first night I watched Moana and it was a good movie, but when I got back I said goodbye
to the first family home I had ever known. We were no longer a family. It was never to be, I should have known that she never intended to get another place with my father,
she had told him that many times. The first few days in the new place were terrible. My nights were in torment, wondering where my mother was. My brother and my father took the other
room (the living room) and I in the bedroom. We had to cooperate, as we were now very close to one another. Dread began to creep in.
I still kept in contact with her, and two months later had met my mom. My studies had started at UCI as well, and the classes were different than Saddleback.
It was 2017, and everything seemed like it was going to get better. I went to college fairs, met new friends, and started to go to college fellowships.
I started the Computer Science track, but had trouble getting parking in the apartments because everyone wanted our cars off the street.
So we had to rotate cars every other day. I also started working at the old McDonalds, where I spent time working during high school. At first I was just 
a janitor, but later got added to the service area and then the drive thru. The days were fun there, only because it seemed a lot of work to balance school and the other duties of life.
I hated waiting those days. It felt like everything took forever to move forward. Each day of college they gave us more and more work.

When I first got to UCI my father paid for two of my semesters and my mother paid for one. The next year, she swiped my 
college fund days before I had to pay. I went outside the place in a place of desperation.
 I was so lucky, that year. Student loans kicked in and paid for my education. 

Pauline, my old high school friend, had always been into languages. And over the years, she continued to learn more.
She was always facinated by certain European cultures and areas. I also had shared some of these. During high school,
she liked Iceland, and singers from iceland, then later moved on to the Scandanavian countries like Swedish and Norwegian. During college
it had become more about Polish and later the Baltic countries like Lithuania.
From Pauline, one could learn the value of perseverence. Her family background was Vietnamese but she had taken the time
to go out of her way to find meetups with Europeans. It was a unique choice, but still it took dedication to learn 
some of the hobbies she had learned. She told me it had taken her three years to be able to talk and recite
in languages that were almost foreign for her to understand. We grew up with a primarily English dominated background, with some forms of
Spanish and sometimes a different culture, but she had taken the time to learn something. And she got the results that she had wanted.

During that time, I met a girl called Diana, who had moved from the Bronx to Mission Viejo. She was similar to me, as she had a mother and brother,
and a similar living situation. Diana was a bit different than me, she accepted her situation, and that gave her more peace than
I would have for the next few months. The impatience and my other issues began to cause me to panic.
Ironically, it seemed like no matter how hard I worked life always seemed to have a way of keeping me down.
Some days at McDonalds, I would cry in the restrooms becaues I felt so helpless and hopeless for the future.
Maybe a part of it was my family still continued to call, and they would say that eventually we would be together, but
I knew it hadn't been real. And maybe it was because others would try to show the illusion of a normal life.
Where then was the American Dream? The American dream seemed like a goal to achieve. I had known it since I was a child, since my mother moved from India and my father, of 
Caucasian decscent, decided to live his life, and to raise a family. 

As a child though, due to some of the personal issues, I would scream in the middle of the night to get attention. Sometimes, doing this, caused the neighbors to get
angry. A lot of the time, when the neighbors got angry, they would call the cops. This was all before the age of 18, but the feelings didn't go away with age. Some of my
behaviors became better when my mother left, because she got involved whenever I first yelled in the middle of the night. She would scream herself at my dad, telling him
that he was evil, and that he caused the screaming and kept the kids up. She constantly took all of our responsibilities on herself, which one cannot do. 
One thing that I had learned over time was that one person could not take all the responsibility onto themselves. Because too much control 
for one person, doesn't work alone. We almost have to work in a team to survive. 

A few months later and I was still stuck in the same apartment, but life had gotten a whole lot different. A coworker asked me on a date. He had brown hair, was a bit heavier,
and much older, but he wore a lot of cologne. And it smelled good. He asked me to go out with him, as friends first, and I thought he was nice and so at first I panicked. Then later,
I agreed. He told me about his past, about the many women he had relationships with, and about the harshness of his mother as well, who had left his father. However, his father had gotten remarried and came to
live in Southern California. He always paid rent, and we spent time playing games together and sometimes staying together at his father's place.



He brought me to my first date. I couldn't sleep the few nights before because I was so excited to be with someone.
We went to Whiting Ranch, and we had lunch at Waba Grill. The first day, he held my hand and that was the first time I 
had ever had a man who held my hand. Within three weeks, he told me about the other women, his exes who had been horrible women.
It was a winter night when we had dinner and he mentioned a woman he had gone out with once before. She was a college aged woman, one who
looked much younger and came from a wealthy family. He told me about her, how she liked classical music and nintendo games,
and how he was broken up when he saw her at work, because she had rejected him. I stayed with
him, but I too began to grow jealous. I started to accuse him of thinking about her whenever he was with me.
In the meantime, I also had college and work, so it was hard to balance my schedule.

He became self-obsessed in some ways, he would eat or take time to do other things when he felt upset. I did these things
as well, especially after my mother had dissappeared. We didn't go to church because we felt angry that the world had hurt us.
He told me about his mother leaving his father, and about being on drugs, and the other things that had happened in his life.
He described the pain the Catholic Church had placed upon his family. And sometimes, it seemed he had been playing a game 
with me.
We celebrated both our birthdays in the spring. Mine was in April, his in May. In addition, he took me to Universal Studio with his
best friend and we saw Hogsmeade from Harry Potter. Hogsmeade was fun, there had been a lights show and butterbeer. I think that day alone, he had spent around $500 alone.
The lights were cool, and rides were fun. People filled the little streets, and everyone seemed to be having a good time. During the two hours it took to 
get there we talked in the car. I learned more about his friend, and her young daughter. 

In May, my college older friend Johan and I went to Crossline Church, a megachurch in the area. I had never experienced a church before,
and something about it seemed to feel like a home I had lost. I met a few people who seemed friendly, including a very shy young man, who we just
exchanged hellos and left, and it had been the same for girls. I didn't take the time to talk to them instead hid in the back row.
One day I took my boyfriend to Crossline Church, a local megachurch. I wasn't a fan of megachurches, but I believed that each church has some
connection to God provided they believe that Christ died for our sins and he will come back and God is a just, loving God.
He didn't feel the same way. He told me that the Church was evil, and he couldn't stand it. In some ways, I could understand his background,
he didn't like the church, and he refused to go there anymore. In the small perspective, I was angry, this had been the first church I had actually
started going to with a young adults program and he didn't want to go there with me.
Ironically that same day, I had met my future husband, but wouldn't realize it for a while.

Sometimes he would say I worried too much and he was correct, but if I worried, then he was too carefree.
Still the days went on. One time, he brought home a switch, and we played Mario party together, that night we laughed and 
talked and sat together in his room with the soft yellow walls and the animals on the walls seemed carefree and happy.
I despised going to school because my boyfriend wasn't there and I had to listen to the teachers. It was very
had to concentrate also due to the fights that I had heard when I was at home, and how I had begun to treat words as 
unimportant. But it was fun to sit together and pretend that we were in different worlds. We would watch TV together,
play games together, watch game lore together, and sometimes even Dexter. We had many different outings where we would 
go see things together, like movies. I would get home very late usually on those days, but it was still fun.

It seemed like a fairy tale, prince and princess, in a time long ago, in a land very far away from here. Somewhere where dreams came true and life 
had a purpose. I kept looking for a purpose in this life.
He told me about the love of his life. Sometimes, it was me. And sometimes it would change to the past, when he reflected
on one of his exes. She was a tiny lady. He said he liked tiny ladies. He liked girls with
cat ears as well, which was quite common in men. I don't fault him for it, but that was the first time in my life where
someone had said the specific phrase, love of their life. I longed for it, to be the love of 
someone's life, and to have them be my love of my life. And I thought that I was going to die without my boyfriend at that
time, because he made me feel special.

He spent way beyond his means though. It wasn't like he didn't want to treat his girlfriend every once in a while, it was more like
eating outside every other day.Another issue that also contributed was his love of a particular game, that would cost a lot of money, which
involved models. The model setswere fun to paint, and I did end up buying a small set myself, and we had times when we painted the models
together. To be fair, everyone has a love of something. Most people call this a hobby. Others, it can morph into an addiction. And at first, I was happy for him, that he 
had something he could have funwith. But some days, he needed it to feel happy. And as he continued to need this to feel happy,
I also had my own needs to feelhappy. I needed constant reassurance that I was loved. So I would keep asking and asking sometimes, to 
the point where I was almost searching hard for love in the wrong places. We felt like we didn't need church, we didn't need anything but the salvation we had and 
the freedom to have fun and live our life. Live our life. The problem was, we didn't know where to find love, and what love was.

Love is the feeling of attachment people have between each other. However, agape love (another form of love) requires a choice to show another person the same love (here 
a verb), or to help, care for, and show mercy to another just like ourselves. And we kept forgetting the action verb of love, because 
we were both too focused on ourselves to get what we wanted in life. I was more ambitious, I wanted to exit college and get a house of my own, and be free of my 
own mother. I also wanted the freedom to buy things that I couldn't while at school. Wheras he focused on living, looking for that feeling of affection from another at the
time. Now after years, he changed his ways, and now is comfortable with himself. But at that time, he was looking for affirmation from someone else other than God.
Months later he had a few sick days that he had taken from work, and I went over to see him. He said his stomach wasn't feeling too well,
and the situation spiraled out of control from there. From then on out, money was tight, he said he had to save more for the doctor,
but ended up having a hard time paying rent and still eating out. I began to criticize him, feeling that he hadn't put enough
effort into going to college, and nitpick at his small flaws. He called me materialistic. We used to go to Taco Bell, and he still wanted to make me happy, so
he took me places. Sometimes, I was upset that I could go to college, because I felt like I wasn't earning any money as well,
and couldn't be fully free of my mother's control. I had never truly had anything that felt like I had belonged (sometimes even in Bible study groups).
I had a decent relationship with him, but we were both immature, and felt angry that he wouldn't go to college. We also had differing 
views about faith, so we ended up breaking up six months later.

After living through the times that I felt like I had to be with my boyfriend, and the breaking of the family,
that (though tough) had not been the end of the world, 
I discovered that I felt sorry for myself. I also discovered ways to stop feeling sorry for myself, not that I was an expert
at it in any regard. My father warned me about this as well. He had OCD for a while, after his mother tried to kill him, and he had been through the foster care system.
I thought it was his right to feel sorry for himself. But he said the more he felt sorry for himself, the more he gave those people
power. Forgiveness isn't about trusting the things and people who hurt us, but about giving ourself back the power to love and not worrying
about the past wrongs. And the more time it took away from him to achieving his own goals.
A method was to look into ourselves in the eyes of the future and the past.
If one could see themselves over the course of time, they would have perspective over a situation. They may look around and 
realize that a small incident was really nothing to worry about.

At school once, a young girl spilled a drink on one of our neighbors. The neighbor started screaming about the drink, because
the drink had damaged her shirt. She began to swear and threaten to sue the other girl. Putting some distance between herself and
the other girl, she began to think she had behaved too harshly. When she began to think critically about the other girl, she
realized that the other girl hadn't come there to harm her at all, and she forgave the other girl. The next day, the girl went to school, and the girl who had spilled
the drink on the other girl came to her and apologized, and asked her if she wanted a new shirt.
And when she did the neighbor girl said sorry as well, and to this day the 
two of them have become friends since.

Although a simple story, I realized I had been feeling sorry for myself over the course of time. I could take a look at the things I had written years before,
about all the people that had hurt me, and all the things that had been done to me. And once I looked at it, even though some people had done it intentionally,
I didn't have to give them the power to hurt me anymore. 
Once I stopped putting so much focus on myself as an individual person, and took a look at the things around me,
I began to see my own mistakes. I had a hard time forgiving the past though, a fact that would continue to haunt
me for many parts of my life (but I would choose to forgive every day). In retrospect forgiving my ex was probably easier to do than forgiving myself for
being so proud and arrogant. I realized I had put pressure on everyone by demanding people care about me. However, I realized that we couldn't trust each other
yet, which was ok. Breaking up at first was very hard. He blocked me and I went to his home. I would look at him on social media.
Eventually, we ended up getting together in the car and kissing, and were together, but sometimes, not really.
His emotions and passions ruled his life, and slowly I was becoming the same way, and I realized that I just couldn't live
feeling sorry for myself any more. But a life of living in the world was hard to leave,
because my emotions felt so strong.
We just couldn't go on if we both weren't going to change, and it was lucky that we weren't married. It was hard to believe 
in God during that time, but I shouldn't have let all of the feelings rule my life too.

That same year I had met the nicest guy at Church. I had known him before I knew my previous boyfriend through a mutual friend and a church service, and 
this young man would listen to everyone, but he had a hard time communicating. That was one of the first times I thought I felt a nudge from destiny, fate
and possibly God. I don't know if it was just a feeling or it was real. I ended up teaching him how to talk by talking to him
about subjects that he liked. This time, I didn't go with feelings, but let my brain overrule my heart, even though my feelings for him and grown.

One time, we went to a bible study together. That day I felt like I was going to explode.
He looked at another girl for one moment, and the jealousy in my heart started to build up again.
We started dating in March the next year. My new boyfriend, as I look back on the past, was probably one of the nicest people I had ever known, because 
I had began to treat him the same way as I had treated my ex. I called him terrible, said his family didn't deserve happiness, because every time I did
something with his family, it seemed like they didn't want me to be there. Seemed, but facts once again differ from feelings, and at the time, I believed
that feelings were fact, when in fact, they were not.
I went to San Diego that year with his grandparents. Especially since he didn't have fighting parents that dragged him into every one of 
their schemes to hide items from each other.

Living with this feelings made fact mentality has made my life hurt in so many different ways. Sometimes, when I would feel like something was wrong,
and when I acted on that feeling, I made my own journey even harder. For example, 

Do two wrongs make a right
During my years with Phil I had both good times and bad times. Sometimes it seemed like we didn't work together at all. I would have times when Phil's family would 
take him on vacations, and because my family wouldn't take me I was bored and sad. At first, I thought it was entitlement. But then I realized sometimes
families do have differences. A popular Christian viewpoint today is that married couples can live together, but boyfriend and girlfriend cannot. That is because
in the Bible, it is a sin to have sex with someone who is unmarried. So taking people of different gender (especially ones who are romantically involved) anywhere 
together would be harder. In addition, families are seen as people who are married to one another. In the Bible this viewpoint is different. Christ called us brothers 
and sisters (children of God). However, there are many verses about obeying our mother and father:
"Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord." Colossians 3:20.
In a clear state of mind, I would have said it wasn't a big deal. Especially with another friend.
But in my paranoid state of mind, where I believed I had to be with a man, I felt like I would die without him. 
I wish I could have gone back and hadn't said the things I was to say, but I could not, and threw a fit with his parents.
Phil called my father there. That day is one I would never like to experience again. 

In addition, having a want is ok, but focusing on it is a terrible problem.
I had to give up the longing for someone else to truly find it. 

I was happy by myself, but a part of me still kept wondering what it would be like to be together. I eventually asked him in February of that year.
Ironically, it seemed like no matter how hard I worked life always seemed to have a way of keeping me down, even after everything I was able to do. I wondered if I had 
sinned against God or had done something wrong. Maybe I was too desperate, but it seemed that life was always hard for me, especially for the amount of effort I had put in.
I could probably even have a million dollars, and I would still be worse off than everyone around me and it made no sense.
It was always like this, since I was a young girl. My mother always compared me to people my own age. 
And she always told me my shortcomings. I was too tall, too lanky, too weird compared to the others. 

What lessons could one learn from that? All I could remember at the time was I felt miserable and would never be good enough, so a deep jealousy grew
in the roots of what once was a good heart. I saw others as richer than me, prettier, smarter, less tired, less ill, less trouble sleeping.
I saw them and they saw me. Does God give us these perceptions of others? I've seen some people in churches who seem to have everything,
cars, houses, and multiple vacations. And others who have close to nothing and I acted in some ways on that fear of losing everything too fast.
I acted impatiently and rashly. Love is patient, love is kind. I knew it in my brain, but my heart, it told me to act rashly sometimes.
It told me I would get what my father had if I didn't act upon the percieved threat. This threat caused me pain and anguish often in life, but it
wasn't a real threat. 

Yet nowadays, in America, we seem to have lost the tradition of family. We don't take care of our families ourselves, often, we will have friends
or families at nursing homes, or elderly villages. For my father, we already knew this was going to be a problem.

The Indian Wedding
In India, the people had a lot of traditions or customs. One such custom that took longer than many of the other customs had been
the custom of marriage. An Indian (and specifically Hindu) weddings could take longer than a week. 
In America, we marry typically in one day. In India, the families would prepare food for the whole 
wedding, and most marriages are arranged. In America, typically the marriage is not arranged, and nor is the choice of spouse. Many 
different aspects are chosen due to astrological signs. 

An arranged wedding consists of a bride and groom, as well as the parents of both bride and groom on both sides of the family,
and their entire family as well. The people get a list of compatible partners, from which the man's or woman's side can
choose from. Sometimes, the parents will want an educated spouse for their partner. It's a different tradition than in America,
where we are free to choose to marry who we love. Speaking of love, the Indians believe that love grows over time, so that
if the two people do meet each other, they can grow to love each other. Some parts of the world are even harsher, with parents or family
members who will kill their own child if their child tries to go with another person (one who they don't specifically desire to be
a part of their family). 

There I found myself, in the middle of the sea of red and color everywhere. They had bought me a suit with a red scarf and pants as well. 
My brother Riley hid behind our mother as the crowd walked past. We saw animals and every type of tent, and an assortment of foods that
one wouldn't see anywhere else in the world. As we looked around us, camels approached, as well as horses. Nobody seemed to know whose wedding
it was just that there was so much around us, and there was a ton of people. Elephants walked in the middle of the street.
Someone said it was because a circus was in town, but in the US we had never seen a circus animal out on the street.
A child asked to ride the large gray beast. It towered over us like it was hungry, and we felt the greatest fear in our lives.
Trembling we reached out toward our mother who wasn't paying attention. This was a common part of the trip, there was just so
many things to do.

The boy and the rabid dog
During the harsh heat, I spent time with a young teenager of a servant
(in America a servant is a housemaid) and my brother. Surendranagar was lonely, and we had no shoes, so we often
explored the surrounding areas. With the glass on the street, the young man showed us how to bind our feet with moccassins. 
One day, in an alley, three dogs appeared in the middle of the street and my brother, the young man and I were standing right
where they could see us. The dogs began to bark and they ran toward us. Typically, if a dog 
runs toward you, you would normally stand still, but my five-year-old brain couldn't comprehend that so we ran and the dogs chased us back.
Eventually I saw the dusty brown gate standing still and we couldn't open the gate, but oh, 
the dogs were getting closer, and eventually the young man pushed us through the gate. I didn't know at the time, but 
my mother told me in the days after that he had been bitten by the dog because the dog had rabies.
My mom didn't tell me any more, she ended it with that, because perhaps she didn't know what became of him, but 
she did know that he had saved us from harm. 

The topic of being saved is also hard to comprehend in the Bible. God says that we are saved from sin, and death is extinguished.
But death, being the second (and not the first death) doesn't save us from car accidents or cancer or other forms of illness that 
can cause death. So being saved is more like a reconciliation to God, rather than physically saving us from death. But the questions would still
continue to linger. Like why had God made some people's lives harder than others to get saved?

I met a young woman by the name of Grace, she was a mutual friend born with a condition that she could not walk. Through that
she has faced multiple surgeries and has led a life of a wheelchair. Yet she still shows the faith that some of us cannot understand.
I asked her how does she continue to live, even when faced with a surgery.
Grace: "Well, none of us are really "good Christians". We will all fail because we are sinful." 
Sometimes people have the capacity to deal with hard stuff, and sometimes we feel like we don't.
And sometimes we cannot deal with really hard problems. But that didn't mean we could live the rest of our lives in the victim mindset.

My Uncle's house with a car and the desires for money
In one of the more affluent areas around Gujarat was our uncle, who had a two story home and a car. Something that looked very similar to 
the US. His home was colored a beautiful blue, and in the backyard they had grass and a van in the front. 
This uncle's name was Arvind, and he had a love marriage with his wife, and two sons.

I had always wanted a suburban life, especially as a young woman. I wanted the opportunity to have opportunities, and to have a stable life with a 
family and maybe with a pet. As a child, it was hard to reconcile, that while on the outside sometimes things would seem to be ok, life
on the inside wasn't. Perhaps it was the turmoil of the constant fighting indoors, or the fact that people tend to criticize others more than
themselves. My parents, due to their divorces, and my mother's lack of job would have a hard time living in California. 
So did a couple at McDonalds as well, whose mother had been homeless. She was a nice lady, but she had two jobs, one more at Disneyland, and 
had a hard time living as the prices slowly increased. She tried to give her children what they wanted, but 
My father once told me that we don't choose to be a victim of abuse, that sometimes abuse chooses us. 
I asked people about abuse, about lives, and how could we know the future, because I wanted to have a good future, not a bad one.
But a life with a white picket fence, and a nice little home in the suburbs with a garden had always been intriguing.

I wish someone would have told me as a young woman that it was ok to feel jealousy, because it exposes our
true desires. It gives us time to know what we want. When people say that God is a jealous God, it is because He wants
us (humanity) for himself. If we really think about that, isn't it normal for a parent to feel that way about a child? I 
interviewed a man once, who said 
Jealousy is bad when it turns into envy, which is the byproduct of insecurity. Insecurity is the byproduct of fear that we aren't
good enough, or as good as others. If we feel that we aren't good enough, and we act on 
that feeling, we can end up hurting someone else or even ourselves. 
In the movie Divergent (ironically, a movie reference) the main character, Tris can use fear to her advantage, to make 
her stronger. She uses it in various ways to escape a dystopian reality. 
If we could use fear to make us stronger, even during life, then perhaps we can see jealousy in a new light. Sometimes
we will get to a certain point in life, and things will seem hopeless, but in reality they won't be.  

Anxiety and the pandemic
Fear can come from anywhere. During the first year of Covid-19 I was a contractor at a company. However, the pandemic hit during mid-March in the 
USA. At first everyone closed their doors and the governor stated that we were in a lockdown. Eventually the lockdown was lifted but during those
first few months it felt like everything was trying to make our world smaller, because I already had to live in a 1 bedroom apartment with my father
and brother. And if my world was small, I can only imagine how much worse it could become. I understood the need for the lockdown, it was because several
people were dying every day. Yet, ironically, it seemed that the more panic the world seemed to feel, the more panic grew internally in my head as well.
The pandemic had an effect on everyone. Some people who had domestic abuse situations were then locked in with their abuser.
During the middle of the pandemic, parts of the lockdown seemed to let up and people were allowed outside, but then soon, it closed down again.
With this instability and unrest, riots also broke out in parts of the US, and people began to act out against the government.

Some pastors just give the church a bad name. Haven't you seen those pastors, preachers, teachers, and even bishops? For example, the one or two cult leaders
that are in your area that you know just speaks of occult. Or perhaps, one or two child rapists who also happened to be priests in the Catholic Church?
Nobody is perfect, but some people will always give the church a bad name. As it is in the church, so it is also in the world today. Some people just give 
humans a bad name. To be fair, but still honest, no man is perfect or sinless. 
Some people can do the opposite, give others a good name. Good doesn't mean perfect, but it means showing the good side of humanity. 
Phil's grandparents, in particular his grandmother had a wise way of looking at life. She was much older, but she realized her years weren't done yet,
and yet she realized that change was necessary. She told us of her prior days, living life meeting her husband who was the love
of her life at the age of 18, travelling the world. When she spoke to us, she didn't judge, but
rather listened. It was an incredible day, the day I first met her. 

Justification of violence
We have seen so many times when a child gets hold of a weapon and hurts another child. It happens so often nowadays that a person, who feels out of control,
will want to hurt another. Usually the person who does this has to justify their cruelty to another. Most of the time, a similar enough reason will exist out 
there for violence. For example the violence seen in the capitol riot of Jan 6, 2021, shortly after Donald Trump lost the election for president, he incited
people into a rebellion.
But when is violence right? When we do the wrong thing, and we believe we are doing things for the right reason, it is often against God's will.
Morality comes from God, so if we take this stance, we are able to discern when we make mistakes. 

In foster care children, a similar unstoppable fear seems to exist. The child doesn't know who to trust, and some days their realities can shift.
Each day a child in a foster home can turn bad or good, depending on the person who controls the home. 
Nick Doorn, known as Johan and Juanito was a young man from Dana Point when he had a stroke
and couldn't....

Mrs. Hilda was an older woman who watched children at a local church. She did an event called Kids Alive, and each year,
they took care of kids on Friday nights, and tried to train them for a play on Christmas. Volunteering to help is very hard because
we don't get an immediate reward. Sometimes, we get snacks, or small gifts, but no money, and we pay in time spent. It occurred once
a year. It took true strength to continue that every day. The children were rowdy. They would throw things around
and nobody could focus. She told me that she had done it for 33 years, and during that time, most of the time she had 
been working as well and raising her children. I asked how, and she said God gives the strength to do so.

When Hilda and the others had the play, everyone was cheering. Half the lines, the children had forgotten, but overall
they had tried their very best. Sparkly decorations were everywhere. Hilda, when she was called up to the main podium, told everyone to stand up if they
had been a parent whose child had performed. Then she told everyone to stand up if they had helped in any way with production. Overall, half the room
of around 200 people stood up. She said, "this is how many people it takes to create something like this". Each person, like a small cog in a machine,
has a chance to be a part of something larger. Even if they don't get to stand on the stage, it doesn't just take one person to gain success. 

Fifteen years ago, my mom went crying to Mrs. Hilda for advice on her marriage, which hadn't been going so well.
She told of my father and his neglecting her wants to travel and for excitement. Sometimes my father had tried to live 
his daily life, with his comings and goings to and from the pool. My father wasn't the best to her, but rather
had his own faults as well. To her, my father had neglected her. But she didn't see her own criticism to him.
In India, where she came from, things were much different. Her large family and cousins adventured together,
saw things together, people lived together and experienced daily joys together, even as neighbors.
In the United States, people live mostly separated lives, even neighbors don't socialize together as they had 
in the past. In addition, their personality differences hadn't helped. Mrs. Hilda listened to her but had a more traditional
view on the world. And in the end of the day, she couldn't help Vina, who wouldn't listen to her.

Vina's life fell apart slowly, first a day at school with the children, the next, a day at court with her husband's ex-wife. 
The ex-wife was raising a child by herself, the child of my father, and to do so, she claimed she needed money. When my mother 
complained a lady at the court told her to get a job. But saying get a job was easier said than done, because Vina had lost years
of her life taking care of her children. She tried to get jobs, she holed herself up in the room upstairs, never coming out except for
food and water, sometimes milk and peanut butter sandwiches. 

Individualism vs Community
In the Bible, Jesus said to be united as one. United as one, sharing community together. When does the price of daily life
extend past the need to help others? And sometimes, going out there, and sharing the word of God during the hard times,
actually helps us move forward from our own hard times, especially when we feel truly alone. But with community conflicts tend to arise, because
people see the world differently. The dreaded conflicts that we always face in relationships, whether small or large, the ones we never think will happen but do so happen, 
often hit us like heavy bricks. 
And we did face conflicts, multiple conflicts. Some of the conflicts were larger than other conflicts. 
Some due to upbringing and some because they arose during our times together. I think he was more avoidant than I was. 
Being a part of a family where the women tended to be more dominant  tended to push men away from being leaders. 

This didn't mean that women weren't great leaders. Harriet Tubman, the woman who first led the slaves on the Underground railroad, accomplished a lot. She was born into slavery, 
and first found freedom on her own. Later she went back to free others, including her family. In fact, later she went to serve as a spy during the Civil War. So did
Ruth Bader Ginsburg in the court system, where she was a law professor, and served in the supreme court.  Although sometimes women can be great leaders, being a leader 
in a foreign country when the person has no idea what they are doing can be quite catastrophic.
With no good support system behind my mother, and her being clueless as to American customs, she had no idea people here worked together 
in families, despite the outside seeming rather individualistic.
 America values individualism, and capitalism, where people can be what they want, but people still tend to stick by their families and help each other in need. 
In addition there were American advertisements that were so different to the Indian ones. 
There was a time where she told me she bought cover girl lipstick and said the prices were very high, and their lipsticks tasted bad. 
Depending on the type of lipstick, some brands were very expensive and others were cheap, but she thought she had to wear them because
 they were American and she thought Americans wore lipstick.

In fact, to fit in we tried to be as American as possible. We didn't learn any other languages except English, watched American shows and tried to act like our
neighbors (which didn't always work out well). We went to American churches, ate (somewhat) American foods, and celebrated holidays. Ironically, it got to such an
obsession that we ended up trying to color our skins the way they covered theirs. My father ignored this behavior that was occurring, and refused to tell us more. 
But often, our mother would compare us to the other kids at school. I found myself in middle school trying to scratch the color off my skin to look as pretty and
white as I could to fit in, to try to belong. At that point in time, I just wanted to be someone, and at that time, I felt like nobody.

To try to gain approval for belonging, in some aspects never truly ends up working out. An example would be in typical high school movies, people always show the one or two characters who try to gain "popularity" or 
fame or achieve something that they aren't, and they usually lie to themselves as they do it. Then what usually ends up happening is that people find out and eventually they 
are cast out and have to accept themselves for who they are. Finally, they usually end up with the romance in school and it usually ends up happy for the protagonists.
Unfortunately, this doesn't happen in real life. The only part that ends up true is that if you live a lie, it tends to come back to bite, in some way, shape or form. 
The times like these never ended well. Personally, during school, and college, and life it was hard to hide what we had been born with, and our culture tended to
get in our way. Sometimes, it had been ok, and sometimes, I felt like a foreigner in the country I had been born in. And to accept it was a part of life.

Ironically, I found a possible way to copy someone else. It was a form of mimicing the actions until you felt like the action you were following. If I saw a group of people who
were happy, I tried to act happy, and believed it was possible to be happy if I acted like it enough. That method sometimes tends to work. 

I met a young missionary years later, Ariana, who was in her early thirties through Johan as well. Ariana told me bits and pieces of her life,
though it was short she said it was important to show that light to others, and to share to
the relationship with God. Ariana became Christian from 18, but she ended up truly having a relationship at 29.
She learned during the pandemic, which was hard because Bible studies were on Zoom and she said she wanted to learn more.
She saw something different in a disciple, a woman from a different church. Eventually she got 
connected to another church, which was a completely new chapter in her life. 

When taking a look at the different world views, a pastor once said that there were only three: naturalistic, theistic, and pantheistic (many gods)
Within each one of these three world views, people had multiple different beliefs under them. The naturalistic, people would say, was a 
worldview where everything came from nothing (or perhaps the universe started from the big bang), the theistic (the universe began with God), and 
the pantheistic (many gods, all who are one, who created the universe, and everything is everything, including beliefs of reincarnation). Going 
through each one of these paths led to more questions. There was no correct answer on what to believe. But even into each different sect, people began
to add divisions between what was a belief. Sometimes, a different sect would emerge as part of each one of these three world views. 
A version of theistic and pantheism, called agnostic, is usually defined as not knowing whether there is a God or not. 
Ariana also had different views of the different denominations in Christianity. She said that people made slight differences,
and had slight changes to their beliefs to create different denominations. In reality, this is because each person deals with life differently, and wants
different things and different circumstances. However, if preaching about a gospel, any church has to follow what the Bible says (and have a basis on the
love that God displayed when he sent Christ to Earth to die for our sins). If there is no basis, any ideas beyond that would be foolish. 

Ariana and her husband weren't Christian when they were married. They had both grown up knowing about Christ,
but they hadn't accepted Christ as their personal savior. Both grew up speaking Spanish, but only Ariana could
speak both Spanish and English. Recently, after meeting a sister, she changed her whole life. 
She expressed tears when she spoke about her husband, as he still doesn't share the same faith, along with her family. 
Ariana loves her husband, as her entire family, even her own mother. I too could understand that because my own mother hadn't shared my beliefs 
for many years. She described a time of taking care of the sick and the needy "because the world doesn't show them kindness"
, where she took to the street to help the homeless in Santa Ana. Santa Ana, one of the cities in Orange County, had a drug and crime problem in the past.
Though the city has become safer, Ariana now hosts a ministry there and in a few other cities around Orange 
County, and has a dream of becoming a missionary. A dream, that for now, is possible, but for a lot of people,
it is hard to reconcile with giving and recieving. 

The topic of being saved is also hard to comprehend in the Bible. God says that we are saved from sin, and death is extinguished.
But death, being the second (and not the first death) doesn't save us from car accidents or cancer or other forms of illness that 
can cause death. So being saved is more like a reconciliation to God, rather than physically saving us from death. But the questions would still
continue to linger. Like why had God made some people's lives harder than others to get saved?
We all know it's easy to accept a good God when times are going well. But when times go badly, people start to question,
"Where is God?" Ariana told me about her encounters with questions as well.
She told me of this one time about an encounter with a lady at a local ice cream parlor. She asked the lady at the counter,
as well as a group of friends. "I looked at her and I saw a person, not just the service she was going to do, which was
sell ice cream, so I asked her how she was doing." 

Ariana also had a gift with words, she could convince people to listen to her, being a talented speaker as well. Her speaking reminded me of my high school and college
years, having some teachers who could speak and some who couldn't. In particular, there had been a teacher in a cultural study (AP European history) that would tell 
everything in history as a story. He was really good, and as a result everyone wanted to be in that class. Upon first walking in the classroom, at first, I thought, history
is the worst subject ever, why am I doing this class as an AP class. Then we heard him speak the next day, and it blew my mind. I felt like I was living in the French revolution, in
France, then one day we were in England with the Victorian era. Each day was different, and because Mr.Stossel was such a good teacher, it was probably my favorite class throughout 
high school. 
In college everything felt overwhelming. During my first year there, I also had a really good teacher, one of the rare ones. She was my first computer science professor, and she
had a way with words. I felt the pressure of work and school, and to do well. The bare minimum was getting through college, but for 
the future, I had no idea what to plan. I didn't understand 

The funny thing about words is that they mean a lot. Well, to clarify, communication, tone and body language, as well as the content of words mean a lot in America today.
People can take things out of context very easily, and weighing that with our attention span being smaller, it makes it quite hard to live. 

Ariana also told me about a time her husband came with her to preach the gospel. Her husband had seen what she was doing, and 
he wanted to see what it was about. He was used to working hard, but couldn't find a way to accept grace in the past. They had 
spent their lives in a Catholic mindset. She said, "When Jesus comes, it's not gonna be about denomination, about helping people get to Jesus"
A Catholic typically puts more emphasis on works, while the normal Christian tends to have a lukewarm attitude toward works.
Both types are living in the flesh (either by the law, or by not seeing that God needs fruit in the world).
And living in the flesh never ends up with true contentment, or true happiness.

Attitude bases itself on many different concepts. People can have attitudes on everything, from things they like, hobbies, 
or travelling the world. People can have attitudes about other people. Joy itself is an attitude that one can have, where they
choose to feel content even despite the circumstances and focus on what they can control. Ironically, the people who we most tend to envy
tend to be content with their own lives. Envy tends to be the dissatisfaction with one's own life or image. Dissatisfaction, the opposite of 
satisfaction, or content. People who have true joy in their lives often choose to have joy. Joy itself cannot be equal to happiness, because happiness often depends on 
emotion, but joy depends on a choice to feel content with one's own life. There was a woman once, who felt envy, sadness, hope
and despair. She had been diagnosed with a brain tumor that had been terminal, but didn't let
it get the best of her. Even as she saw herself aging, she never seemed to wither from her choice to choose joy. To this day,
she (Jessica Oldwyn) has a blog, and continues to post on that blog with the attitude of joy. She lives life with her husband and daughter, and despite 
having setbacks, she has survived for the last 10 years with a brain tumor

Despite the fact that a brain tumor cannot cure cancer, there is no guarantee that our attitude doesn't affect the way we live. Sometimes, it even gets
in the way of small or big things in our life. People don't tend to exercise, or go outside if they feel ill, and sometimes, their attitude only makes it worse.
Ironically, we've all been guilty of saying, I feel ill, when in reality we have not been ill at all. 

Why does our daily life feel so exhausting? Jobs we work tend to have an effect on attitude as well, or even self-employment.
Or rather, our attitude tends to reflect on the jobs we do, and the amount of effort we put in. Ariana herself worked for a counselling line, and decided one day
that she didn't like the job, and sometimes the unbiblical aspects of the job, and wanted a new career in ministry to further God's work. She decided to put in
time and energy to apply for the jobs in Ministry. She said that it was a calling to ministry.
It would have been equally as biblical to work in a secular job, due to the fact that the bible also defines working for the Lord. Yet it was something to ponder in our daily lives,
what jobs we could do. My father used to quote Colossians 3:23 says, "Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not
for men, knowing that from the Lord you will recieve the inheritance as your reward. You are serving the Lord Christ." He, and a few others like him,
did not have the luxury to look for a second job. But even so, he realized that he did like his job, and eventually, I adopted a similar attitude. Even during our jobs daily, there is the fact that we have 
to put in effort. Now some people say this is hard to do. I know now it is very hard to do.

Missionary from Japan
Elizabeth, a missionary who went to Japan, described Japan's need for the gospel. 

Rebecca and Rosie Conti also knew faith. They were sisters who had once travelled around the world,
but who grew up having to take care of one another, along with their brother. The three of them 
knew God's love, but having to choose it was hard. 

	Is being a vigilante a good thing? We think we are protecting something, but then we are not.
In life, we will often have good and bad. Good deeds, are fruits of the spirit. But people often tend to want revenge,
thinking it is the right thing. Where, then, is the end to revenge. Where does the fruits of pain end?
We think about storing up our treasures in heaven. If we hold a gun or a weapon and use it against others, sometimes we 
think we are protecting people. We see it everywhere. However, it takes more than just a gun to be a true hero,
and everyone knows that in their heart. Sometimes, it can take a choice to forgive, or to show mercy to someone 
who has wronged us. And in life, we will always have a hurt.

	Leslie de la Rosa, my friend from Saddleback College, was born in the Phillipines, but she also had a hard
time during life. She said her faith made her stronger, but strength cannot be fought by us alone.
Leslie's father had been abusive. And so often nowadays, we see that happening, but her mother finally got free
and moved to the United States. Abuse is so common nowadays. She said she had to work her way through school,
and had a hard time trusting people. For Leslie, she has a hard time caring about her father at all, 
but she had forgiven him and let go of the past hurts. 

	Leslie spent her life trying to cope with the pain. She sometimes reminisces over the past, dwelling on the 
thoughts that she had before, wondering why things hadn't gone differently. Sometimes she regrets the past as well, but
she knows that she cannot go back, and so at the end of the day, she knows she must let it go. Leslie once told me,
"You need to grow up." And she was right. However, it hadn't stopped her life from being very hard. Leslie's parents were divorced in the 
Phillipines, and she came at a younger age, so she had to adapt to the culture. That, along with the fact that her father was abusive, made it
difficult.
On the other hand, Pauline's life was considerably easier. She lived with her parents, who would take her on vacations, and other family
events. However, they wouldn't pay much attention to her during their daily lives, often on account of their other duties, and sometimes
parties or other events. 

	They couldn't have been better friends for a time. Both girls were around the same height, had a similar look, were both Asian in some way, 
were both INTP by the MBTI signs, and they both shared a love for adventure. They would text each other often and do things together.
However, they had differences as well, Pauline liked other cultures, while Leslie was more into anime and games.

	Leslie had changed so much since she had been in college. She and Pauline got in a big fight around a year ago, right during the middle
of the pandemic, after we had been locked up for many months, not knowing how dangerous covid was. Pauline's world felt restricted, while Leslie's 
world had changed slowly. One day Pauline sent her something stupid to get her attention, and Leslie didn't like it. This created a huge rift between the two friends. 
Friends. A friend is a person whom one knows and one has a bond of mutual affection, typically exclusively of sexual or family. To be a friend, one must
also show love to the other person, this love being an action. Some people would call this the golden rule,
treating the other person the way they would want to be treated. However, this cannot always be the case. In the women's fight, they didn't want to make peace
with each other, Leslie wanted to stay away from Pauline, and Pauline wanted her attention whenever she was in the area. Eventually a few other girls got in
the fight as well, and that just made the rift even deeper. Pauline's pride couldn't take the fact that the girls didn't want to be friends with her. 


Thanksgiving. Originally the act of giving thanks, a day set apart to give thanks for what we have. Thanksgiving in the USA
was an event that started with the Mayflower, which had stopped at Cape Code. The date was around November (either 11 or 21), 1620.
The pilgrims came from England, and they learned from the Indians how to grow corn, and they had small harvests. The Indians and the 
Pilgrims set aside their differences and worked together, to create the feast. That day they also had a feast together. Thanksgiving today has been 
comercialized. In stores, we see turkeys, turkey plates, cups, pies, roasts, etc, so that people can have a meal with 
their families to give thanks. My family didn't celebrate thanksgiving much, as children we sometimes went to the store to pick up banquet meals.
Sometimes, the holidays were days that they could just relax, so they didn't want to take time to prepare meals. But most of the time, we had thanksgiving 
at a my brother's friends place. Usually for lunch, their parents would cook everything and leave it out there. They were Indian, but their family had adopted
American traditions, so it had been a mix of Indian American traditions. But they still did things together as a family. 

Some days, it felt like the world was falling. Falling due to every little bit of pressure acting up on us.
You know, one of those days. And yet, it seemed like work was piled on every monday, more stress during the week.
Then later, it seemed like the same thing would happen over and over each week. Friday, Saturday, Sunday, the good days, the times meant for 
relaxation and rest. And yet the Monday always came. One particular Monday, I got a stomachache, and started yelling in the middle of the day.
Every sort of profanity, loudly. Smacked the walls, cried, tore up papers. Nothing in particular happened that Monday, yet it felt like the day
was long and weary. But despite that being the case, maybe I wouldn't have done so, had I seen the outcome. Papers flying everywhere, and amidst
those papers, a small looking bow. Within the bow was a gift, I read under it.

That November of 2020 had been hard. After I had met Phillip, I had come home to find my father and brother. And my brother and father had been very
lazy. They were always to the extent a bit lazy, my father barely left the house to go to the pool, and my brother almost never. Sometimes, though, when
he did he would hang out with a friend. But 2020 had been a quarantine, and during the quarantine, people couldn't just get up and leave their 
homes for any activity. In fact, most places had been under a lockdown. But during that month of 2020. It all started March 2020, when the Diamond Princess cruise ship
entered the US and infected people with covid. Eventually other travellers, began to spread covid.

I hadn't been too smart during that time, and so I thought, well now that everyone's began to quarantine in their homes,  I thought, why not buy a home too. But homes were too
expensive to buy during that time, and I was only a contractor. But I was only 22, and so I thought I was invincible, and could do whatever I wanted to anytime I wanted to do it,
which was very dangerous. Sometimes, if we think that we are invincible, we will tend to do stupid things without thought, or careless things. Sometimes, we have the best of intentions.
I thought that we should buy land due to an old interpretation of the Bible, which said that people should not live together before marriage due to the fact that they may have sexual
intercourse, and the way to bypass that rule would be to buy land, build two homes on it, and let Phil live on one while I live on the other. Ironically, other ways to bypass this rule also
was to make a choice not to have sexual intercourse before marriage and live together, or to not live together at all. But I told Phil's parents this plan. 
One day, after we had set up everything for the land, I spilled everything to Phil's parents, and they were angrier than I had ever seen them in my life.
They thought I was trying to use their son. 

As a child, my favorite book was a book called the secret garden, which taught me the power of positive thinking. The secret garden went into details about how to believe in positivity, and
how positivity is like faith. Faith is a choice. 

As Phil would explain to me later:
Positive- negate the negative 
I can instead of can't 
I believe in God even if you don't feel like it 
Feel jealous then tell yourself the things others have didn't matter 
Remind yourself of things you have 
I can survive the work 
There's always next time, even if I fail this time.

Take action based on positive 
Breathing 
Doing actions to please God
Doing things with the object of your fear like Phil 
Be patient 
Perseverance 
Even if people die they reunite in heaven 

Goals - no more instant gratification 
Happy things for future 
Wedding 
Honeymoon 
Manor house 
Watching Tv with Phil or playing games 
Gifts for family 
Spreading of the gospel 

Sometimes the above would work, and sometimes, it didn't really stick to my normal, and I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to follow it,
but knowing I had a choice made it so different.
Sometimes the work got really hard, but mostly I didn't try to exercise on the days that I had trouble with stress and trouble sleeping.
I would usually complain. And it wasn't right to do, but I did because I felt like it. Then I would tend to overeat, and stress
worry. Sometimes I worry that work would kill me. This had become a cycle, from when I was a child, and to break out of the cycle I had to let
go of the fear's cause.

I have a mild form of Pure O OCD. My family has a history of mental illness, my father had OCD as a young man, his mother was paranoid schitzophrenic. 
When he was younger, he couldn't walk on cracks, or he would become frozen. He picked up trash on the floor, and washed his hands almost 100 times a day. 
If he didn't do these rituals, he thought he wouldn't be able to stop trying to do the ritual. I noticed similar behavior as a young adult and as an adult.
1. Fussing to others, sending texts
2. Calling parents to make myself feel better
3. Buying groceries to avoid the pain if I had trouble sleeping
4. Trying to finish all my work in a day instead of pacing it out
5. Laundry and dishes excessively 
6. Vaccuming the carpets where I ate once a day
7. Buying gas when the car had 7/9 bars of gas
I felt physically uncomfortable when the rituals weren't complete. In addition, with the other fears as well: the fear of the insomnia, of being in pain, of being in an accident or dying.
The nights where I could not sleep at all, when I felt that life had no purpose and no meaning. Sometimes, they would occur on days that stresses would occur on.
Most of the time they had been dealing with my mother, and how she wouldn't come home and get to see me before I died. Especially if I died, I wanted her right beside me. I hated uncertainties, and 
didn't have an anchor for my soul. And from my fears, there came a few that would not leave. 
1. Fear of period or any pain keeping me awake 
2. Fear that sleep would not come (or my body would not work)
3. Fear of work being too hard 
4. Fear of dying of cancer and lack of sleep and leaving Phil alone or not getting married 
5. Fear of being jealous of others who have more like Pauline and other friends or not being like others 
6. Fear of God not being real or caring about me
7. Fear of disappointment if I tell myself that I can sleep but I can't 
I felt these cycles in the past, and I feel those cycles even today.

As a child, I would have multiple cycles where I would think I was dying that day, so I had to live life to the moment, do 
everything, and this do everything in the moment caused a world of stress and panic if I didn't live life to it's fullest. I had to almost,
like a compulsion. So I would eat and have fun and live like there was no tomorrow. This wrecked my health. In addition, sometimes, I thought my
mother wouldn't come back to see me before I died. So I would cry about that, because she was insensitive. I projected these feelings onto my boyfriend and 
ex-boyfriend in the past as well. Thinking I had to see them or else I would die, I went nuts, tried to stalk them and think about them all
the time. It made matters worse because the more I thought about them, the sadder I would feel.

The only way to end the cycle was to focus on something else, a focus that didn't come easily. I had to almost force my mind off of the same fear
that would consume me. Sometimes, the fear of stress added sleepless nights, that then became another cycle of trying to live for now, and having the same
sleeping or not sleeping troubles. And this had ranged on and on. 

The key to breaking the cycle lied in CBT, an exposure to the fear, in addition with behavorial changes, like
physically not calling, fussing, or trying to limit grocery shopping to necessary days. I had to use a calendar, and even so, I still sometimes slipped up and 
did the things I wasn't supposed to do. 

Taking actions based on the positive was hard without any motivation. Some days, it felt like the total lack of motivation existed because 
everything was too easy, and other days, it was rather that the motivation was very hard to achieve. I tried to look for motivation, and found that it was hard to find the harder
I tried to look for it. It had been easier on some days when I hadn't tried to look for motivation. Motivation, though material, mostly benefits in what we 
gain for ourselves, but sometimes, the motivation is inspired by God. Meaning that we want others to come close to God, to be secure by God. And that motivation tends to 
last longer than the selfish motivation, which seems to pass at the wink of an eye. But the motivation most of the time was like I didn't want to 
do anything.

	In fact, I wore dresses because they were one piece instead of two pieces of clothes. Additionally, sometimes I would wear sandals or slippers 
as shoes, because the shoes took too long to tie. As a younger woman, I would wear the same sweatpants over
and over again because I didn't want to put in the extra effort. But sometimes, that effort is a necessary form of effort. Phil on the other hand, has a larger 
tolerance to effort. He has multiple clothes that he will put on, shirt, pants, belt, sometimes watch, glasses, shoes (with laces). Ironically, that seems to be 
a small number compared to some others. People can put on makeup, do their hair, and everything from A-Z just before going to work or school. But they do it
for a purpose, they help themselves because they want to be like each other at some level, and that isn't wrong to do. It only becomes a blocker, at least in 
life, when we focus on those things and value them over friendships, and over loving another as ourself.

On the other hand, taking actions for the more positive was also hard during the days of sickness or illness. Sometimes, sickness can make people feel
inadequate, or feel worse because of every type of pain in their body. One part is having nothing to do, the other part is that 
the world doesn't seem to stop moving, (for everyone except for the person who is sick). Sometimes, people can feel good on sick days, like taking
a day to relax or let go. In the cases of truly devastating sickness, questions like "why me" tend to pop up! To combat the little and the large during the sick days, usually I would try to think of more positive topics, but sometimes,
I let my guard slip, and the thoughts would slide out into the world and sometimes would hurt me. But it was just thoughts. Knowing that they are just thoughts,
that our power isn't in the hands of the thoughts, but rather of our own choices, makes us much stronger. It allows us to see past our failures, and move on 
in pursuit of God, love, and caring about others. Sometimes we need to write those things down, the good things, so that we can remember those things.

We know we are in the victim mentality when we think:
1. Bad things always come to us
2. Others are the problem, or the situation is the problem to our true unhappiness, or lack of joy
3. No point in trying to change our lives

A way to getting rid of self-pity:

Building smaller goals:
- Taking care of smaller issues first, before adding onto bigger issues, allows us to focus on the issues at hand, in particular
- Allows us time to focus on the small victories

Focusing on giving to others:
- gaining joy from giving to others

Gratitude list :
- writing down a list of things that we have

Closure to the past, forgiving others:
- letting go of past hates
- being able to focus on our hopes and aspirations

Defining ourself differently and not as always in a victim state
- Telling ourselves we are going to be ok regardless of outcome (even if we don't know the outcome), which comes with faith

Sometimes it's ok to go on a walk, to get out of a situation where we don't feel comfortable. Rather than taking out our temper on someone else, walking away may be the best
idea. 

A cat purring
One day, we heard a cat purring outside, and woke to find a cat outside the window. It's purring was loud, and the soft "meow" of the cat usually speaks to something 
it feels or sees around it. Some people are cat people, and some people are dog people, or both, or neither. Usually, in the form of the question, "Would you rather 
have a dog or cat if you could only have one animal, you could pretty much guess who had which preference to those animals. Whether or not we had been cat or dog people
the only thing that we thought at that time was about the cat. Who takes care of stray animals anyway? With my other issues, and the worry of not being able to 
take care of animals, at first I felt worried that I would have to take care of the cat.
Then I felt jealous, that I couldn't seem to take care of the cat like others could, and it took a while to adjust to that. 

As a younger girl, we had multiple pets. A guinea pig, multiple fish, three mice, and other types of pets. But we never seemed to get along with the pets that 
we had. It seemed that often, the pets were neglected, just like the outside chores. Our parents, guilty of the same things as we were, often forgot about their
daily duties in the pursuit of living life. My mother went after success, and my father after the stability and comforts that he tried to bring back into his life. 
And often, the animals would then die of something. Sometimes, it just seemed that we couldn't handle the animals. My brother and I were even worse, we rarely fed them.
Partly it is because in other countries, animals were usually more free, so in different cultures, people wouldn't think of those types of animals as pets.
Sometimes, there were people with pets as snakes, or lizards, but even so, those required more care. 

I wasn't the only one who felt the way I did. Plenty of people feel like they work very hard, and nobody seems to care. Care being the operative word, because
the world is in sin. Maybe some people would call it immature, or entitled. Perhaps, I felt this way due to neglect or a lack of family support.
A lot of 20-something year olds are immature. So are children, and teenagers. However, this doesn't make their opinions stupid, rather it makes their opinions  different.
People can learn a lot from their children, or other children around them. But, there are times when egos get the best of people, and they say everything children do means nothing.

Sometimes it takes a while to open our eyes to see the world around us. Small things seem big, and big things seem small. Just today, there had been a broadcast
about a woman who knew she had terminal cancer and she was Christian. She cared more about her child not thinking of her as sad and pathetic, and would rather see
him think about her as strong in the Lord, despite the fact that her mortality was soon known. And her mortality, just like our mortality, is crushing because we go into
a semi-unknown. We have so many questions about life and death, for what our purpose was in this world, to God, to others. We have to take a leap of faith that
everything is going to be ok because even in knowing that the time is near for us to die, will we have truly lived?
Christ took that leap of faith first, trusting God's plan. Christ was God, but he still died for the sins of humans. 

The more I thought about that, I realized I didn't have to live in that world where I couldn't put effort, or didn't have enough time to focus on the effort
around me. After all, some effort, was necessary. Just like having to take care of a parent in the future. One day I wouldn't have to take care of a parent, because
my parents would have enough to take care of themselves, and then one day we would all pass on to the afterlife with God and Jesus. But I wanted to live
recklessly like other young women. To follow my dreams, to have the fairy-tale romance, I wanted the chance to be crazy and to make my own mistakes.
It was like using a gopro to go on adventures. I wanted to go places and see things that I hadn't seen before.

Some days, I was happy, on other days I was sad; and the mood swings seemed to occur all the time. Especially in the past. Starting with show-and-tell, the classrooms with the 
rows and rows of students, but usually small enough for the children to fill around 30. Brown desks, soft lamps, teachers teaching their students. Small, comfortable,
but almost always, someone wanted to be the center of attention, and I was not that girl. Usually, I was off to the side, trying to hide from the teachers. Most of the
time, I was near to the door. And almost always, I didn't have friends. And that day, on the day of the show-and-tell, someone brought something expensive. You can guess,
their grandmother's jewelry box, and then a few children brought keepsakes, from family. Something about that box stunned me, it looked so beautiful, like from another era.
She also had a picture of her grandmother. The box looked like it was antique. 

Another day in December, the air was so cold. I looked on social media, and saw a post of a woman at a local church. And of course, she was bragging.
Just like in the past, when is it right to brag? She had just gotten to go to a game for hockey in the local county, and decided to brag about getting tickets. And this was common
on social media. A few months ago, a woman bragged about buying a home, and marrying the so called "love of her life," going to Hawaii, and other things. It's so typical of people
to want to brag about their best assets. But sometimes, we know that it's not the right thing to do... especially if every post of our life is about us and our life. Sometimes,
we don't know who we are influencing by posting the message on social media. It could be sending the wrong impression. But it's America, and people want to see materialism,
and everyone tends to follow a similar culture as the others. I don't know what the goal of bragging is, all I knew was that, I didn't want every one of my posts to be about my life or my family, because it seemed too small and encapsulating to 
fit in a whole world. I liked working, and doing things that were bigger than myself, to help others as well. I wasn't perfect. So I bought a box too, and decided
to try to fix it up.

The box reminded me of another time, when the mood swings had changed their course, and I remembered a small lamp, softly glowing by the trees. My mother and I met another
friend from the same school with a mansion and many relatives. Their mansion had around 20-30 rooms, and many different people. It was like a little city, but made up
of a family. Inside, the fairy tale life seemed almost real. Glowing lamps, chandeliers, everything that one could think of was in that room, and more. 

On this particular December, a few days before Christmas, I was feeling particualrly stressed about giving away all the gifts. Two years after the covid scare first hit the 
news, this would be our first Christmas with people indoors as well as outdoors. Last year, the mask rule was much more strict, and most people hadn't been vaccinated, as the
vaccine had been in it's trial run. But this year had a better chance of hopes than the previous year. Trees were for sale everywhere, and the Spectrum center had an ice rink. Disneyland,
Knotts, and a few other amusement parks had also opened up during the holidays, in hopes that people would have more immunity than before, in an effort to get life back to normal.
But normal had so drastically changed from the days of our parents. During our parents time, it had been far easier for people to meet in person than to text or email. Despite the 
fact that some parts of the web were working, the majority of not in person conversation had taken place over the phone, on large telephones. People also used larger VCRs, and pagers.

Because today the internet had connected people so well to each other, it had limited the need for in person activities (not eliminated).
Some things hadn't changed, like people would still need to go in person to a doctor, but in the days pre-covid people wouldn't have made as much of a fuss to meet
together as today. And in time, that had made people grow apart from one another. Technology wasn't a bad thing, rather simply a tool to be used as such, and there are 
arguments for the benefits and the consequences of technology.

A wise woman once told me, "All good things require effort."To have children or not to have children, and whether it is beneficial to each person or not, is a question many people in society ask.
There are pros and cons to both having and not having children. Having children was a bonus to a relationship, adding companionship value of the children,
and more joy in the relationship. Not having children pros included better financial standing, and more time to do other activities.
This coupled with the fact that people can adopt also added options for young mothers who couldn't raise children, or adults that couldn't have children
but wanted them. Most people people who have had children say they would not regret having children, despite the effort.

Sometimes, having children in a bad financial situation would harm the child more than would be a benefit. Some families, to avoid the cost of day care, will have a person stay at home
from work to care for the child after the child is first born. Others cannot afford that luxury. In trying to live this life when I found one thing, women who have traditional
housewife or housemothers also have a hard job. 

Change can also occur in the form of having to take pills or surgery. For example, I just found out that people had to take birth control pills for years before they could have a 
child because many couples could not afford the rent as well as babysitters. Due to this, birth control pills would change our bodies, and have weird side effects. As of now, because nobody wanted to
raise a child I would have, I didn't tithe as much to the church. Sermons, from pastors, and from local people would tell the people to tithe 10% of their incomes, on the gross or on the net. Sometimes, they didn't
try to push it, because tithing would be from the heart. When I tried to, I felt really really sad, because I knew that the more money I spent, the less I would have to give to my family.
I thought about this subject today a lot. On the news, I had seen another issue where a housewife had been told by her husband to have plastic surgery. Now the man made a lot of money, and she did not. Having herself under the plastic surgery was almost like
her way of paying him back. This issue also occurs in gold-digger relationships, where the man wants a younger or prettier woman, so he has her gain breast implants or other types of implants. The question was:
would it be worth it to have those in order to please the husband in the relationship? Most people would say no, that what you do to your body should be your own choice. Contrary to the opposite opinion, having sex in a marital relationship was seen as healthy.
Otherwise, some will say, what is the point of marriage other than to procreate, or to have a relationship with God involved. I wonder if it had been worth it to be married at all, especially at the age
where one couldn't afford to have a child, or other disasters would be met if the person had a child.

I recieved multiple different types of advice on the subject. Some people mentioned protection (typically protection gives a significant decrease in STDs and having a child). In addition, some would say the 
opposite, having a child is a gift. 

To decide on having children was another story. Some days I felt as if I wanted children badly, on other days, I wanted the freedom to do my own thing, to live my 
own life and to have the money was to have the power to live my own life. Both thoughts were hard to debate between. Despite the joy of children being incomparable,
several of my friends had taken the child-free approach.
Being a more responsible person would take years. I was only 24 but I was about to get married, in two months, and the reality of a wedding at a church had surprised me.
For the majority of my life, I had believed I would be a single woman. It was almost unfathomable to be with someone, especially when everything didn't seem like it 
was real, and to be with a non-abusive person was a lot better than what had happened to many others. But it didn't matter whether it was better or worse than another's choices, at the end of the 
day, what mattered was what was in our hearts, and our decisions, and our decisions would affect the outcomes of the future.

I had a few hard decisions to make that wouldn't happen to other people, but each person's experience is unique to them. Two days ago, I saw a post on the internet about a mother
looking for a home for her three children, as well as herself during a separation from her husband. The court system had made a strange demand, that she stay in the area (not to mention that this area was expensive).
She was only 21, going to school, and working. These children were young, two were but infants.
She reminded me of my father who had children at a young age, was working, and had a strange court order. She had been living in a living room of a friend's house.
I couldn't help but wonder, how many of these people would wander by without a glance. At first, I wanted to give her a place to stay, to have the children stay with us, but Phil got upset.
I should have asked him earlier, and by messaging the lady first, I didn't respect his decision. I cried for the children, but there was nothing we could do, we would end up splitting two of the
children from their mother, and didn't have enough room for three children, and the liabilities that went alongside this. 
At this point, I couldn't have one child and couldn't afford to take care of that child. With the costs of day care being around $2000 and paying a large amount of rent,
I couldn't take on much more responsibilties at the particular time. Maybe in the future, that would be something I would get to do, but the only thing I could think of now
was to hope and pray. Hopefully she would be able to help all the children. 

The more I had inspected for myself, the more I realized I had taken for granted. People, gifts, things, love, didn't have to be given to me. Even eternal life didn't have
to be given to me. But the longer and harder I wondered about it. Particularly because the younger generation seemed to focus on the here-and-now. Some of the younger generation were
our peers, our friends, people who were in high school or college. They had a newer outlook on life, they thought that the world was theirs to make of. And in some ways, young
people have the power to change things in the world. When a child is born, we hope they will learn to live, to change things that needed fixing, to make the world a better place. 
Each child has their own journey throughout life, where they can make the most out of their situation. Children also learn how to trust. They trust their parents, to keep them safe, no matter
what country they are in. In some ways, they are helpless without their parents. However, children seem to have something inside them, something that makes them special, perhaps, an innocence
that leaves as they grow up into this world.

In my early twenties, I had made a mistake. I sold a piece of land that was worth twice as much a few years later, but in my haste, I had sold it at a lower price than my parents had 
bought it for, and they had accidently left it in my name. Partly it was an overreaction to the situation, I felt trapped with my father, and partly, it was due to 
vengeance on my mother for leaving us. In the bible, we are supposed to forgive, so the consequences of the actions would haunt me for a while. Putting life into a mold, making things small always seems to hurt
our life even more. And I had tried that for multiple years, but doing the same thing over and over had it's consequences. I always thought of things in a lens,
and looking through a small lens makes life a lot more difficult. Living day by day, living for the moment of pleasure, actually takes away from living life. There's a saying for it,
looking through rose colored glasses, or as my mother would say. If we see everything as the grass is greener on the other side, we end up focusing on the wrong things as well.
And everyone makes this mistake, it is so easy to slip into. Another friend said it also, a young girl around the age of 16. She said that having a different past changes a person. She hadn't learned
these lessons from herself, but had seen through others and friends.

Last night, I went to a barre studio in Ladera Ranch. It had been my first time, the eucalyptus scented towels, the small weights and tiny balls was different
than what I had seen before. The people wore makeup, and had a different tone of voice than what I had heard. I had heard of families before having different cultures, but never
so much as what I had seen that Thursday. In Irvine, it was a whole different culture, the children were younger, parents were usually working. People emphasized schoolwork, and the 
whole city seemed to be uniform. Houses looked the same, had the same style of building, and seemed to match. A city or two away, Lake Forest had been smaller, the houses had a different style, 
and the city seemed to be a lot more relaxed. A few shops had opened up within the years, but mostly, there seemed to be relics from 20-30 years ago that hadn't been 
remodeled. Most of the towers that had been built in Irvine weren't in Lake Forest. In Ladera Ranch, the culture seemed more family oriented. Ladera Ranch was nested among the south Orange County
mountains, well away from the freeway. The buildings looked very similar also, but had a nice, almost home-like look. The shops even seemed more expensive then here. That was the first exercise I had 
tried in a long time without much pain also, partly because it was low impact. The dance studio seemed colored in a soft brown light, they had songs, and tiny weights, and the class lasted for an 
hour. When I wiped my face with the eucalyptus scented towel, my face seemed to feel very fresh and clean. I wished I could have gone there more, but each class was expensive, and it was hard to pay 
for it with all my other bills, and the responsibility of a young adult began to kick in.

We also went and did things with our friends, those last few months in 2021 before 2022 came. Sometimes we would go hiking, play soccer, or simply go to the movies. 
The one time I played soccer, I was like the worst at what I did. The second time I went, the next night my spine hurt, and I had so much trouble sleeping. But I wanted to be cool,
so I followed what the other young adults did. I tried to be like them so I could fit in. The second time I went, once again, I got nervous about the ball. Despite the game being
relatively fun, I was afraid of the ball hitting me in the head. I cowered a few times when the ball came toward me. Talk about a goal for the future, be less scared and in pain of the soccer ball.
New years resolutions! Speaking of new years, since everyone had different goals, change would happen. God said that it would happen, that we would either grow in our journey or weaken in our journey.
Our journey meant change. One of the main goals I had accomplished in 2021 was moving out of my father's apartment. It had taken a few months before I could move out, but the moment I moved out,
I felt stress but then also relief, that I wouldn't have to worry as much about moving out anymore, as I had already moved out. But I moved out with a roommate, and I had to coordinate
schedules and lives with him, which wasn't always easy. However, this year, I wanted to achieve goals, to become like financially stable, to be able to have a kid years from now, and other things as well.  

But change is not easy. Change meant having to let go of some things. Basing my actions based off of pain that I felt in my heart, or even real, physical pain in my eyes or in my legs or back.
Change meant also like giving Phil independance, and not doing the same things as he did was hard. In marriage, when we think about being together, being together doesn't mean being together 24/7. 
It means being together sometimes, and giving each other space as well. Sometimes Phil will tell me that he needs space, and he is a very patient guy, so it sometimes seems out of character. One time, he went
to go with his friends, one time, he went to go with his family. When his family took him to Zion and Hawaii, they practically had to pull him off of me to get him there. I wanted to be with him so bad,
and I thought something bad would happen with him gone. With him gone every day, I had to live each day, day by day. At first, it felt so lonely, nobody to go to later,
and nothing to do. Another unhealthy assumption, was that he would always be around. To count on someone else other than God is temporary, because everyone has things to do, their own agenda,
and also the circumstances in which they are in. Injury, pain, death, change, life and other things are real, even if they didn't seem like it. And the more I had been focusing on these things
the worse I got.

Last night, Phil left to go hiking with a group of men and women, and my legs had been sore from the day before. I called my father, and asked him if I should still go, and his advice was, you don't have
to go unless you feel well. Sometimes, it is hard to feel well. With the obsessive thoughts, and sometimes erratic imaginative thinking, I can feel ill and not truly be ill. However, the day before, I had played
soccer, and my legs felt weak. It took Phil a while to leave the place, and it had been the second time since he and I moved in together. He usually sticks around, and waits for others to make a decision for him. Phil himself is somewhat indecisive. So then I had to let
him go and do his own thing, and for the first time, I felt a bit of relief, as if the burden had been loosened on me to make his decisions. Once making my own decision, I could now focus on what I wanted to do,
even though it was painful for both of us to break the bad habit. To break the second bad habit, we had to let go of our feelings controlling our actions.

The second time Phil left to go with the men in his family, including his uncle was the sunday after the first sunday. Phil left and went to Northern Los Angeles, to see the San Gabriel mountains, but he couldn't bring the women in his family, because
I had already booked a time with them a week prior to go wedding dress shopping. Before this day, my mother had promised me her dress for free. We drove miles to her storage, and my father had to drive around 60 miles that day in total to help my 
brother as well. At first, we combed through the storage to find her old dress. She had spent $700 on the dress, and that, in the past had become around $1000 today. In addition, she had to pay for fitting as well, and 
other things during a wedding. But there was nothing in the storage except for boxes upon boxes of clothes. We had a few jewlery, and I found an old album of baby pictures, that I took with me. One of the other interesting things is the amount we will spend on a wedding. 
It seems like during the year of the wedding, people's pocket money seems to be very low. During the fitting at the bridal shop, we went through three to five dresses. The first dress I got into, I was able to fit my face through the arm, but not the rest of 
the dress. Once there, I got stuck in the dress and someone had to get me out. The lady in the shop tried to put the arm around the dress, and eventually it was fixed. In front of my future mother-in-law and sister-in-law, I tried on four other dresses,
then picked one they liked. I thought it would make them happy, and in their mind, they thought it would make me happy. After all, my father told me to make them happy, he said that if I wanted friends or family, it would be necessary, so I followed what 
he told me, and I tried to change, and be nicer. But my anger at my own mother also grew, for leading us on a hunt for something that had been lost, and for blaming us after for not finding the dress. I spent around $200 that day on a discount wedding dress,
one that was comfortable. While the idea had been decent, maybe I shouldn't have cared what others thought so much at the time.

Caring what others think, sometimes a bad thing, sometimes a good thing. 
Also praise report, Phil's family had an uncle, Jim, with a wife whose parents were divorced before, and his uncle talked to him and told him to be patient, sometimes he and his wife didn't get along or would fight and rebel, and sometimes we don't mean what we say.
His uncle said he wanted someone different from him when he first got married and he said that they are still together today and his father may not understand 
because  was so different than his parents and the rest of the family which doesn't have a 
record of any divorces and rarely argue, but rather, never arguing is rarely a good thing. When we think of divorce, we think of the four horsemen of divorce: bad conflict resolution.
The horsemen are contempt, criticism, defensiveness, and stonewalling. Contempt is saying I feel better than others and have pride, defensiveness is saying, I feel attacked and need to defend my pride,
criticism is saying I would do things better than you (stemming from pride) and stonewalling is when someone shuts someone else out, caused from the three other behaviors. This in turn can cause both people to get angrier at each other.
There was a video on it, a TED talk, where a statistic was given that people whose parents had divorced hadn't been as bad as people whose families tended to argue a lot and refuse to settle their arguments. When a family refuses to settle an argument calmly, this type of 
behavior can slowly creep into the children, and the children can start acting like their parents. 

But a statistic also has the converse of not being true for each and every person, despite the fact that statistics make it more likely for people to have that particular outcome. 
A statistic makes us into nothing more than a stereotype, and people are humans, children of God who are much more than just a stereotype. They have thoughts, feelings, and emotions, and can overcome
even slight issues. While having a person that was similar to me was nice, it didn't define me as a person. 
Some of the more sporty adventures of our friends was really exciting to see, especially because I didn't get to do this often, and partly, it had been by choice.  My parents had thrown me into a one bedroom apartment with my brother and father for the last four years,
and only told me I had the opportunity to change it, not the guarantee that I would be able to change it. I moved out with Phil after 2 years, and got a place to stay with him, with the aid of both of our parents letting us live at home and not charging rent.  
I had a mortgage (combined with Phil) that I was paying more to each month because I had a higher-paying job, a job as a QA, a wedding coming up in a few months, 
and other stresses at the age of 24 so I couldn't just move away. I wasn't the only one, some people had more stresses, my father being one. Having
a child at the age of 21 couldn't have been easy, and also teen fathers and mothers also, have a lot more responsibility. And responsibility means also choice. So partly, one of my choices was to watch others in the context where they would explore the world,
and achieve successes in various ways. 

Living together with your fiancee is never easy. No matter how easy people make it look like on TV. This is not commonly seen in more traditional families, because people tend to correlate living together with having sex together. But living together
can take many different forms, including living in separate rooms, separate homes on the same property, or living together in the same room. The more liberal families tend to side with living together as progressive, if people are going to be married it is seen as ok, better financials, and more time to get to know your spouse before you get married. 
Living together, however, to a traditional person can seem like the emotional intimacy would be huge, as well as the sexual intimacy. They also assume that it would give people the wrong impression. Phil, from a traditional family, had originally wanted to move in together after marriage. I was from a more liberal family, so I
thought personally, it didn't seem as big of a deal because people didn't have to be in the same room. At this point, my father had also moved out with his first wife before marriage as well. In addition, my situation at that time had been pretty cramped. Due to our parent's 
separation, I lived with my father and brother in a 1 bedroom apartment, in a high-cost area. When I sided with my father, I had the opportunity to visit my mother's apartment. But due to the fact that she moved multiple jobs, she ended up moving to a motel. Neither my brother, nor I wanted to live with her due to the 
instablility of her life, she moved jobs continually. We also wanted independance, which we got more with our father. Somehow we managed to all end up in that apartment, and my mother had moved to West Virginia a few months later. I also worked full time, and so did my father. Both of us had worked from home due to covid, while my brother went to school. I was in the bedroom and my brother was in the living room with my father.
For people to visit us, they had to get past my brother and father to get to me. For two reasons: God forgives all sins (and we decided together that having sexual intimacy before marriage wouldn't be an option), and the second, I didn't want to stay with my father forever,
instead wanted to take the next step in life, and living alone was too lonely.

Before I moved in with Phil, I got several comments about the place I lived in being small and cramped. Partly, I think that's what made me want to get out. From ex-boyfriends, I got, you aren't rich enough to complain about where you live. At least you don't have to 
pay rent. I didn't have to pay rent because my father was helping me out at that time. I owe it to my father the fact that I am able to get out and get a place to live. I tried living alone once, a few months in November of 2020. Rented an apartment for two months,
and it took up a lot of my salary. That apartment was close to Phil, around 1 mile away. But it was a cold place, the heater was broken, and there was many bugs. I wished to live with the man I loved as well, and despite my new independance, I couldn't stand the fact that it seemed so far away from
everyone I knew. Phil didn't want to live with me at that time, he said he wasn't ready yet. One time when I was at my father's place, Phil said it was annoying getting through the gate. Because the apartment had a gate, and not many car spots to park at, I felt bad about
myself. I shouldn't have taken that insult onto myself, as he didn't mean it about me or my father. But I got mad, and started screaming in the car. Life back then was hard to talk about. 


Lately, it hasn't only been me, because on Netflix and other reality TV shows, we have seen areas which seem very open and spacious compared to our area. I think because we are in a higher-cost
area, life has been a bit of a struggle. 

Pastor Ray Bently, one of the pastors on KWve, a radio station for Christians, passed away the past week. He was a good pastor, a good teacher. Sometimes, I heard his sermons on the radio. It had been kinda sad to see that there was going to be
no more sermons from him. The news was that he was 64. 

The question of change can also occur when someone decides to mirror the actions of another person. There is an old saying, imitation is a form of flattery. Putting my own personal feelings aside, I had to make a judgement to a question about
what was right and what was just my emotions. So for example, if someone was posting stuff about their life on social media, which seemed to be showing an idealistic way to live - for example showing off their or their family's wealth, 
and was a teacher of the Bible in some form to other peers, would that teacher be justified? Sometimes this did happen in churches, in fact, in the US people tend to be lukewarm Christians because they don't live in
as dangerous circumstances as in other countries. In Jude, we are warned about false teachers, Jude 4 says, "For certain people have crept in unnoticed who long ago were designated for condemnation, ungodly people, woh 
pervert the grace of our god into sensuality and deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ." In some ways, even despite the fact that they are in some way, shape or form, compartmentalizing their love for God, if they are showing off success with God,
was that right? Some people can end up looking up to, or on the converse feeling envy towards that sort of lifestyle. I know, in my life personally, I tended to look up to people who were more successful, as well as feel jealousy toward them,
and sometimes that had the potential of being dangerous. To be successful, without God would
be empty, because we can't take anything with us except our memories. However, I know that also, gaining success is a matter of perspective, and there is nothing in the Bible that says having success is wrong. So it was 
merely a judge of character, what would we value more. If there was one or two people that would come to God from these teachers, is it wrong to have them in a church. Paul even said, if they are preaching the gospel, even if it is for the wrong reasons, then it is 
still preaching the gospel. However, sometimes the jealousy we feel towards another can actually make us stronger.

Lately, I also felt infuriated, and angry about everything also. Partly because anger is a protest emotion, as has been said several times before. I had a problem though, with trying to be "the good girl" and to operate patiently. 
The ability to cope with these angers and ideas with the world come with God's love though. And the hard part is accepting God's love for us, and from then, we can accept our anger and emotions. Accepting my feelings here and now, as angry, is not 
a bad thing to do. It's not bad just to feel this emotion that I am feeling, on and on I tell myself. 

To add to this fact, a young woman now, but during my school years had become a rock climber on youtube, with a few thousand followers. Which actually sounded really cool. Another girl in my school started a few dance studios in Texas and also
made "it" so to speak; or basically got a business of their own. When I looked at myself in the mirror, sometimes I would feel inadeqate. 

The question of right or wrong heart would ultimately rely on the teacher. They would have to face God and explain their reasons behind what they do. If they chose to live a life without God, reliant on their material things,
they will have to face the consequences, regardless. So it didn't really matter in the end of the day to target the person who was spreading the lies, or showing off with their life. 
At the end of the day, I don't think it's worth it to worry about the false teacher or not because they can't harm us unless we let them!

I also did something really intellectually-challenged. I found myself at an impasse, with the choice of acting irresponsibly or responsibly. 
Months before the wedding, I started inviting people to join it. First it was just a few, then a few more, and eventually I couldn't stop inviting people.
Eventually, I had to cover myself by giving a link to confirm the amount of people that were going to the wedding itself. But there came a time when I needed to find the number of people, and waiting until the last minute wasn't 
the smartest idea, so we had to create a website online. This website would help us find all the people we had invited and let them RSVP as well. The website had some gimmics, but it did work eventually. While working on this website,
I didn't realize the amount of things I had to also plan, including food, catering, guest list, dresses, bridesmaids, groomsmen and more. Thank God for the internet, it makes everyone stay more connected, and working together is very easy to do. 
Not only can we work from home, we can now participate in events together, and in person is a lot better, because it's a lot more special now due to technology than not being in person!
some people do not like technology, as they worry it will take over their freedoms and lives. But in this case, technology is actually better than not technology. 

Soon the day would come when we had to take the covid booster shot. A local couple, and also our premarital counsellors got covid the previous week and suffered for around a week with the symptoms, but the shot was also painful. 
The shot symptoms took a day, with three different types of vaccines, each novel at the time, made by Pfizer, Moderna, and the typical vaccine version, Johnson Johnson. The two MRNA vaccines (the two former) caused more pain, but had 
more symptoms than Johnson Johnson, but the J&J vaccine came with other side effects like possibility of blood clotting. However, we didn't have much choice when we picked the booster. The first time, when picking the vaccine, we had all three options,
and Johnson Johnson had a 1 shot option, so I took 1 shot instead of the other ones that took 2 shots. The night had been the worst, my arm hurt, then my head hurt very much. I hope that this week, the booster shot will not kill or harm us, but 
I am unsure. At the very least, I would be able to take the shot with my best friend. Phil is still my best friend. We work together, and do a lot of things together. With the previous vaccine, Phil had a hard day, but when I got it, he took me to get
ice cream with him, and we had fun together, despite the fact that the day was painful. I hope this Saturday will be better than the last time we had the shot, but I was still unsure. 

Today I am going back to the barre studio in Ladera Ranch. The date was either between today or Saturday, but on Saturday, due to the shot and my trouble getting out of the room early, 
I decided on today. It was slightly exciting. I also watched the show From fit to fat to fit, a documentary where personal trainers got fat, then thin again with their clients. When I was losing weight, I wish there had been
someone like that for me, to help me lose weight. However, I knew that it would be selfish to expect someone else to damage their own health to help another. But it was also part of a TV show, so some of the parts may have been over-dramatized as well.
Barre studio was nice, but this time there had been a lot more women that had been there than before, and because there was a lot more women, they all started talking about baking. Then one of them mentioned kids, and 
rising minimum wage for her kids. All the women then divided into groups and began to talk. For a rarer occurrance, I then kept my mouth quiet. It was very strange, I felt nervous of talking because I felt outnumbered
by the amount of women. Typically I see guys around me, except when in Bible Study. My father and brother are guys, Phil is a guy, Phil had a brother who lived with him as well, and I hadn't lived with my mom in years. I think the last woman I had 
seen was Phil's mother, because Bible study also had taken a break. Even work had a majority of men and less women. Outdoor sports, as well as hiking, had an even number of men to women. I think it was harder to communicate because I had seen so many groups of
men. For my mother it had been the opposite though, those days outside our school, or even volunteering. She lived in a neighborhood that had more women in it, and that time she had also been friends with some of the women around her.
In addition, my father was working, and during that time she didn't have to work, even though she wanted to. But still, the discomfort was pretty real.

And the thing is, it's not like I didn't want to be friends with those women. A lot of them had apple watches, and nice rings, and I felt like I just couldn't talk because I didn't have apple watches or a nice ring. Phil had bought me a ring for $30 on amazon. I had an old ipad and a really cheap cricket
phone or apple watch because I had been poor and raised very frugally. I thought that if I tried to make more money, I would be selfish, and if I bought things because of that, that would give in to desire. In fact, I thought, and still do think, that the 
more I work, I will cause myself a heart attack from the stress. And due to these thoughts, and that I couldn't afford some of these items, I didn't buy them. But I did want these things, even though I knew they were just things, partly because they symbolize
freedom, and the more I had, the happier I thought I would be. 
In the past, I hadn't been able to afford these little things. The instructor was really nice, but one of the women said that she felt jealous of the
others who didn't sweat, and she looked at me. I didn't say anything, but I had sweated a little bit, and also this was low impact exercise. I was the slowest at hiking, the slowest at soccer, had previously been obese, and had lost a lot 
of weight, and on top of that had a sugar addiction. Maybe it was all about my attitude. Maybe if I changed my attitude, I could have talked, but something in me just felt too intimidated, just like I imagined my own mom had felt years ago to the white
women in the area that all had prior knowledge of the culture that she just didn't have.  

On the day of the shot, I woke up way too early in the morning. In fact, it had been legitimately in the middle of the night. I had a bad cold sore as well, and the vaccine was coming up pretty close.
The pain itself only lasted around 1 day and 1/2, the next day, my headache was still there, but was getting less and less. In fact, I felt less flu-like symptoms as well, less chills, fever, etc. I had misjudged 
this shot as well. During the middle of the pain, I cried out about God, I asked why he wanted us to suffer. Suffering always seemed so far away, but then, just like faith, Christ didn't want us to suffer at all. So how could there
be a good God with pain? One theory is that a thousand years is but a blip in God's eyes. The more I learned about attitude, I began to realize what the purpose of life was. Each person is part of the body of Christ, each person does
their own part, or follows their own part of God's plan. Each person has the power to change their own attitude, and to change another's life. If I had my own purpose, I didn't have to fit in someone else's shoes. Because trying to fit into our mother's 
shoes, or a different generation's shoes is really hard. The prior generation also wants a lot, weddings, ceremonies, not as used to covid, in person church services, women to take care of children and the home while men take over the brunt of work, women
to be pretty and petite. Haven't you seen that, people who are seen as traditionally male and female are more accepted in our previous generation? To us nowadays, we feel different, because our circumstances are different. And it's ok to be unique.

Last night, I saw a few hockey players on TV. It had been interesting to see that not all sports required people to be super athletic or strong or toned. In my past, I always thought people would need to be so much more different than my friends and I. 
My high school best friend Pauline, had just been on a weeklong trip to Oregon. She went there with her family, then came back to ride her bike in the Orange County area. In school, we are taught that doing well means getting good grades, which
means getting a job, which means having a good life. That train of thought, however, takes away from creativity. If everyone goes to school, gets good grades, gets a job, and has a good life, will there be anyone providing the jobs? A common argument would
be that school stifles creativity. Sometimes in school also, we were taught to do sports, to join clubs, or to do activities of our own. But those hadn't been mandatory, rather they were called extracurricular activities. However, people do end up doing 
extracurricular activities. Some high school and middle school classmates had become entrepreneurs. They were always doing extracurricular clubs and activities as well. 

I wanted to be someone. Someone who can change their life, and change the lives of others. They said that the disciples went out there, did life-changing things. I wanted to have a career, to be something, to be married or to have a purpose
beyond myself, to do something with my life. Easier said than done, just like everything else. Most people know that life tends to get boring, and repetative. We had reached such a state where everything seemed repetative, including going shopping, working,
eating, and doing other typical activities. But routine is a lot better than the alternative, which was to be uncertain of life. However, I also noticed that the anxieties hadn't left, some had just simply become dormant. My head hurt a little, and I found myself 
slipping back into the old habit of self-diagnosing. I checked for every type of disease. 

Today, another day, another difference. Only today, I had watched a sermon on friendship. Or perhaps learned a lesson on friendship from the speaker. It was that people require people to go through life, because we are only
human and can only do as much as a human can do. The speaker talked about 3 different types of friends, ones that bring us down, ones that bring us up, and ones that keep us the same. And we have the choice to be one of these
three types of people. Did we want others to be the same, better, or worse versions of themselves. Sometimes, I think I was the middle type of person, trying to keep everyone the same. But the more I thought about those close and sometimes middle friendships in
my life, I thought that I had been the worse friend, because I would always complain. It seemed that people didn't like to be around others who would complain a lot, and sometimes, I had the tendency to do that. Women also tend to fall into comparison, jealousy,
and cliques (shorter groups). But if we keep a frown on our face, and refuse to be friends with others, how would others know that we cared, or that we wanted friends. Sometimes, I thought I wanted friends a lot. My mother decided not to come to my 
wedding, and I knew I needed someone other than her to come. The worst part was the look on Phil's face. 

At first, I thought the look on Phil's face was tradition. But I didn't just see that sad, pitiful look on only his face when I told him my mother wasn't coming to the wedding. It was on all of his family's faces. I felt like a stranger
in a different world. I thought my mother loved us. Yes, she did steal our father's money, and she did invest it, but she also believed that to love others, she had to love herself first, and so she went out and got success. 
But the first time loneliness hit me. Lonely, the absence of connection, loneliness, the absence of people. But I had both. Sometimes I was in crowds, then I only had loneliness. Sometimes, the technology made it so. Zoom calls helped in some ways, but
in all honesty, technology did make us lonelier. Relational disconnect. I wasn't really close to people around me. 

Today was awful, I got up in the middle of the night with worries about becoming a software developer like my parents and failing. Last night I wanted to be a part of American culture again, just like when we were kids.
 But this time, the feelings had gotten even worse. I talked to Phil and my father, because it seemed that my friends once again, mostly American, had gotten more opportunities than I due to stupidity. 
But the worries about becoming more isolated, more lonely had me wondering if I would go back to being a more masculine person. I was only 24 and already a breadwinner. As a young woman, when I was at Saddleback college, 
and studying programming, I neglected to take showers, played video games, gained weight, and acted like a guy. I hung around most guys because there were  only guys in my family, as my mom left us. I also am hotheaded, 
but was very nervous and unsure of myself on the inside, with some self pity that could be pride. Is the amount of masculinity for a woman a choice? Would I end up a combination of man and woman where I would turn into an aggressive, 
dominant combination of both man and woman?

Sometimes there is an argument that masculinity and femininity are regulated by progesterone in the body, and how much one is exposed to that at birth or before birth. However, another argument is that gender is a choice,
 because in some ways gender is a tradition, while biological sex (male and female chromosomes) is not. With the exception of intersex, birth with both chromosomes. And if we could choose to have certain traditions, maybe 
stereotypical male and female, for me personally, wouldn't be an option. Perhaps I would have to settle for a milder version of a woman, while still keeping some assertiveness. But I knew to get out of this funk I needed two things: 
humility and beauty, born of faith and nurtured through hope.

Now some people would question, why both? There was an article from psychology daily that said: Why does beauty--that of an extraordinary sunset, for example--affect us so deeply?
Beauty inspires us, by reminding us that the extraordinary is possible. Beauty comes from both inside and out, on the inside in the form of humility, and the outside in the form of effort. 
On both counts, it takes effort, and I know that my journey ahead will not be easy.

The second day of humility. Trying to let my pride not to get the best of myself. The days ahead will not be easy. Today we are meeting two people, a guy called Anas Wally, and Phil's sister. Wally was a friend of ours who
was interested in Business as a degree. Wally wanted to see the world also. Wally was from Libya, and he had lived there during a civil war. Everyone knows how dangerous a civil war can be, but only few experience it in person, and Wally did.
Some of his family was killed, especially children. The one thing about war movies portray well is teamwork. Usually you see stategy, followed by teams of men who call themselves a brotherhood. One in particular Restrepo, in 2010, was about a US squad (platoon)
in Afghanistan. Restrepo shows the nature of combat, but also about a bond between the men, and the distress that they face. A few people take the brunt, and some did die. Heavy words.
The men had dedication to their duty as a soldier and commitment to one another as brothers. Similar to the soldiers, people have a tendency,
when they are or feel like they are in combat, want to work together or flee. It's called the fight or flight response. Wally's parents, who stayed in Libya, banded together and sent him to the United States as well as his brother. Wally had a hard time,
and moved from Costa Mesa, to Fresno and rented a room, and moved back to Santa Ana. Today we are going to see him. 

Blanca, whose two oldest sons had died as young men also showed a tremendous amount of courage. She remembers her sons, she posts about them sometimes. I remember both of her sons. No parent should have to lose one son, and yet, she lives and doesn't
despair, despite the fact that sometimes, I bet she feels that way. 

Today they hired two new developers. One was the husband of a woman who worked with us. She did a hard job as well. The other was a South Korean. Which was pretty cool if we think about it.
However, I don't know why but I felt sad. I wish I had been able to have the chance to maybe have a kid too. But maybe, she has a child as well, just recently born. It would have been an exciting 
time for her. Maybe someday, my time would come, and I would get a harder job, and be more like my parents one day, or that maybe I had let them down. I was born in America, and I had lived in Southern California for around 20 years now. To be fair, it wasn't like 
I didn't have the opportunities that others did, but the issue was that I had those opportunities, and cowered in fear of taking them. My father was too picky, he got multiple chances, and he didn't take them, and I was the opposite, had multiple chances,
and worried about them. I talked about those chances multiple times, running things over and over in my head, and when I finally came to a decision, it seemed that opportunities had slipped by. But on the converse, when the opposite happened, when I took a shot too fast,
I seemed to always miss the chances, then again, humility takes patience, and I could still wait for the right time. The third day of humility. 

Today is the day before my period. I am worried about the pain being too much to handle tomorrow, and I hope I will be able to go to work. Because the work is hard of course, and a lot of 
our tests have been failing. The devs have a lot of technical debt, we have a lot less knowledge of elixir, etc, is partly what makes it hard to work. In addition, our load is not easy either. We have many things that were different than before. 
I am worried about failing myself, and I don't want to be either out of a job, or not good enough. Also today, I searched up the amount of car crashes in Laguna Hills, and there were fatal car crashes in our area as well! 
Who would have known that if we paid this much just to live, we wouldn't be relatively immune to a car crash. Ironically, our area had a smaller number of car crashes, but 
there still was a number of crashes that were local. It was always on the news. 
This made me feel very scared. I worried for myself, and for Phil, and family as well. 
Also just a little tip I learned as well yesterday. People whose families had grown up in America know a lot about the culture. The same goes for our elders, they
usually know more about life than we do, because they have more experience. So their advice should be taken with a grain
of truth. 

Another day of pain. Last night was really hard, I was freezing in bed, and couldn't sleep half the night. My stomach felt ill, as if I had to go to the restroom,
and half the night I felt in pain. The pain passed, but the night was hard. I am afraid that today, I am going to have the monthly cycle. And I'm also worried about dying.
I wonder because like people don't move their eyes after they die, so I am afraid that I will die and can't move my eyes and will be eaten alive by animals. And most of all,
I would miss Phil on this earth. God exists, I am worried however, that life is painful after.
Today we learned that there were three types of enemies. Goliath (big ones), Saul (logical ones), and Eliath (jealous, manipulative ones). The Goliath problems tend to 
hinder us, the Saul's keep us focused logically, but not in faith, and the Eliath's keep us emotional, stuck not being able to think. To beat them we need faith,
faith which, even small, can keep us going. This faith is hard to come by, but is very, very strong.

Today is the worst day of my life. We bought rings last night, mine diamond, his gold bands. I've always thought in the back of my head Phil is too good for 
me, and the night was the worst. I worried that I would die, that I would let him down. Riley had left the day before to UCR, even Riley who had never moved.
It felt like too many changes all at once, and then I felt like I would pass on to the next life. But in some ways I hated God. This was just a fleeting emotion, but the thought stuck.
Why would God let me die, why would he let me die so young before I could be married. Life seems too good to be true if that is the case. The sleepless night continued all night.
In addition, the period pain gave me hallucinations as I saw myself dying before marriage in so many different ways.
I felt a weird presence of peace in the morning however. Like a weird sense of peace, after I decided to live in faith. It was a strange experience, and in some ways, perhaps it was the Holy Spirit.

We figured out why our mother seems nuts. She has a thing called delusions. She thinks differently. Turns out the key is to be open minded, but this is easier said than done. I had these as well. When I feel the delusional thought coming, for 
example, like if someone is out to kill me or hurt me, I logically know it's not true. But I keep the thought around because it feels like safety or security. Eventually that thought leads to other thoughts, like if I stop doing the ritual,
something bad will happen. One of those thoughts was going to my father. If I looked my father in person, then I would be safe. When I didn't, I was in an unsafe state. For people that say God is a delusion, He is not. A delusion will most likely
end up causing more trouble than it is worth. The fruit produced by a delusion will make it harder for people to live, not easier. Even grandiose delusions end up causing harm, because the person ends up needing to feel that way
so that they can go on living and not give up. Everything in Christ's life, teaching, believing in God, sacrificing his life for us and then saving us from our sins, would sound a lot more irrational had it been a delusion. It would come out 
incoherent. Yet Christ, when he spoke, wasn't incoherent. 

Some people cannot see their delusions. And yes, everyone has at least one delusion that they believe. However, the key to breaking the delusional thought's control is to be open-minded. And being open-minded means that we have to be 
open to loving others, to loving ourselves. Being open-minded also means listening to others, and trying to understand them. Phil does this really well.  
The next few days, I grew more jealous and less jealous again. It seems like it won't end but I know that the jealousy will come and go in time. I didn't want to pay attention to it too much though.
today I did something stupid, I accused my parents of not paying enough for the wedding. I don't know if children are supposed to expect that from their parents. Only Phil's parents wanted to help.
My father also paid for my DMV stuff (like basically my smog check). So then I felt a little bit bad about what I had done. Also Nick, our disabled friend, hit a pedestrian a few days ago and 
sent them to the hospital, which was even sadder.

For the second issue, I am within testing it out. I am going to meet kids and volunteer on Sunday of this week. In addition, I am going to the Barre studio today, going to three places in one day. Hopefully
this will get rid of our issue that we are afraid of. I think I know why it's happening. There was a scene, in an rather typical high-school movie called Sierra Burgess is a Loser. Sierra was a girl that had the girl who didn't think much of 
herself, she was plain, had a famous dad and a beautiful mom and felt bad about herself. She befriends Veronica, after Veronica gives her number to a guy. Veronica is very beautiful, but her mother constantly pushes the kids to do things to 
make themselves more beautiful and acts like a victim of her father. Sierra ends up catfishing a guy by accident. She ends up getting the guy hurt pretty badly. Later one of the other girls says something interesting to her mother, she says "We can't keep living as if 
someone's going to screw us over." She had a valid point. In the TV show Hoarders, the people always live their life like they are a victim. That type of life leads to materialism, of us not feeling good about ourselves.

When Jaime says to Sierra, "You may not be everybody's type. But you are my type." Did it matter who was out of what league, or which people were liked better? If God loves us, we are His type of person. Maybe our habits need to change, or 
sometimes, maybe our attitude needs to. But being in or out of someone's league gets us nowhere. 

Evidently, it took the whole day to get the point in my head, from where my thoughts were driving me nuts. To the outside, where I could finally feel peace. I felt boredom with Phil, bored with the scheduled life, and wanted some
different things for life. I didn't want Phil to hit his head into the wall when he was angry. This was during an argument. He got angry, and he started hurting himself, which was his go-to method. That's when I realized,
I was tired of being wrong when I thought I was right. Phil had to go to the ER. I called the 911, then they sent someone there. My father also came. I cannot count how many times my father has 
had to step in for us in times of need. We both realized we had a lot to work on, and we needed to take time to be further apart from each other.
That part was hard, because I had never grown up with much boundaries in the past. 

The next day, I woke up too early, same issues, trouble sleeping due to the cold weather. 
The cold weather hasn't just affected me, it also affected some people that left southern CA. A few winter storms have occurred in places like Nashville, Texas, etc. Some people who grew up around here also wanted to leave,
like my friend Pauline. She went to LA and visited LA several times over the last few weeks. 

In my mind, apparently, I was thinking that something bad was going to happen to me. The Church also had a barbecue for their anniversary. I tried to encourage one woman who had a rich husband, not to join in.
Prior to this week, I had read a post about her complaining about the church nursery. So I didn't want her to yell at me. Ironically, I didn't want to be yelled at, and for doing it for the wrong reasons, God has His own irony. When I went in meet the people,
I dressed the same as them. But I was nervous. I went into the restroom, then introduced myself to the women. And the same paralyzing fear, it came back. Then they asked to interview me, and I was polite. I tried to be polite so that God would see that 
I was trying to change. And in my heart, I was trying to change. They asked me a few questions about why I wanted to volunteer there. I said it was obvious, I would have a kid later. Then I may have said a few stupid things, like I didn't know how to volunteer.
In my heart, I thought the children were very cute, and are very small. But somehow, they marked me out as unwanted, and I couldn't tell why. I was then told that I would be called when needed, but I don't think they would ever call me back. One woman however, was kind,
she told me about her husband's prior divorce. 

I think the same problem that stemmed from the past had driven it's way to the present. We were told that we weren't good enough because of how dark we were, and it seemed we had to work harder for everything that came in life.
Sometimes that attitude had a big effect, and sometimes the attitude had a smaller effect. However, anyone with eyes to see could see that I had done this to myself. Phil had some of the wisest advice to give after that. He said, don't just be someone's follower, he said
to truly be their friend, we had to do things with people, not just follow them blindly. Because a friend is a lot more important than a follower, a friend shares ideas with another friend. 

Last night the drama got worse. Gayla, the woman planning our wedding at the church said one of the pastors left. Then eventually, we would need to get a different pastor. She then asked if we could maybe postpone a date. 
I think it's because the pastors don't like us, but I am not sure why they actually said that. We really wanted that date. Maybe all the pastors had been booked up that day, but I was truly unsure. And would it matter either way. Last night, I came clean 
about everything. At that point, my heart hurt, and everything just came out. How Phil and I fought, how he hurt himself, how he had to get staples in his head. After that, I described even more, how our head hurt, how we didn't exactly act normal,
and all our mental health issues. But it didn't matter. The only thing that mattered, after all of that, was our choices. It was our choice to do certain things, and our choice to not. And to change, it required a choice of patience and kindess. 
Just like discipline, making choices to affect our life sometimes harmed us, and sometimes helped us. But it was our choices to make those decisions at the end of the day. We cannot blame anyone else for our actions. 
Last night, I made the choice to listen to Betsy, and Annette, and others. I heard about some of them having cancer, others who had trouble with jobs, and some whose family had passed away. Each person also said, their decision was to follow God, 
to remain committed to their choices.

My heart hurts. All of today, I feel a pressure squeezing around the heart area. I'm not sure what to do other than to worry.
There was a disturbing case about a young woman who died in the 1930s and a guy kept her corpse around for 7 years. I couldn't stop
crying after I heard. Was this what would happen to me?
I also felt the worst pain I had in the morning. Why was it so hard just to be well off, it felt like I had to work and, honestly, to work was very hard, because every few days,
I felt like I was going to die. In fact, I currently feel that way. I got mad at Phil today and yesterday and he took it bravely. He didn't hurt himself at all, which
was a massive improvement from before. Phillip was strong. I wish I was like him, so that I could face this pain/angst or whatever it was.

Last night was really fun. We went to the wedding planning meeting. Five women sat in a circle, when my father, I and Phil joined them. The chapel was beautiful at night, and there was a lake close by. We went inside, and saw the bridal room as well.
The ladies had different roles, one was a photographer, two were meeting planners, one a florist. They showed us what the big day was going to be like. It was exciting. Even though we had to pay for it, partly, the ceremony was cheaper and nicer because we 
had been members of that church for a while. In addition, the planners would do the work when we were there. Our colors were going to be blue. That was probably the first time my father had been to a church in a while. He normally didn't come to service
due to working, watching it online, or going to the pool. He did believe in God. 

Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good. Sometimes we put passion on the things that we think we need, or the things we think we are 
lacking, which causes pain. Dealing with the source helps. Sometimes, I feel unmet expectations as well. Like yesterday, Phil's sister came over. And she's really nice, like we met, cooked food together, and she brought
over the ingredients. She was really sweet about everything, paid for the stuff. But in the beginning, I felt a flash of anger, like why did I have to put in more effort into my life. Effort in the form of anything brought
stresses. It wasn't her fault. The other time was hiking with our friend Pauline. The good part is, we get to take a lot of pictures and act like it's the most fun thing in the world. But actually doing it (the terrible 5 miles) was a lot harder. Most of the first part 
of Red Rock was uphill (meaning at least a mile uphill) sweating in the heat of a semi-arid desert at 3pm during a heat wave. The second half was the trouble carrying my body uphill, because I was so out of shape. But to Paul, and to Phil it was easy. And another weird thing,
nobody felt the need to eat while walking, except me. My assumption was eating while walking would give us energy to continue to walk. However, nobody asked for the food, so I didn't either. On the other hand, everyone seemed to need the water a lot. In fact, Phil was in front of 
all of us, and Paul and I stayed somewhat together. I was the slowest, no question. Two miles in and I felt like my skin was about to fall off. During the middle, I hid behind a bush and tears began to fall. At the end, it was almost 6pm, and we raced back to the car
to get to a tea place. I started to run, and the others just walked. I swore in the middle of that trail, and then cursed everything. I felt like a failure, because everyone was good at something. However, that didn't change the facts. It took 3 hours to make it 5 miles, but at least it was over. 

Weeks before Valentine's day 2019. I remember that day three years ago clearly, I had classes at university, Phil was working. My ex and I had tried to get with different people. He told me if I asked, he would want to be friends with me. He told me, you aren't going
out with me, and making it hard for guys, so why not just ask someone at all. At 5pm, before my work, but after his work. He said, "Hi you called?". I said "Yeah....". Long pause, couldn't talk, felt so nervous.
Then I mentioned, "How was your day?", and he said "good, thanks.". There was another long silence. "You mentioned you wanted to talk to me". The dreaded question. I got really nervous and started talking really fast. "Please don't laugh because this may seem funny
but I was wondering if you wanted to hang out with me or like something for Valentine's day? Please don't say no, or don't say anything if you want to say no because I'm really scared." He said calmly, "What makes you think I am going to say no?" That was the first time
anyone had ever said that. So then I asked, "So what are you going to say?" And he said "sure, why not? Just send me where". Ironically a woman asking a guy out, and a guy saying sure, why not, shocked me. I wondered a lot on what had just happened that day.
The sadness and guilt and happiness all at once stunned me. I couldn't speak that day at work. Went to McDonalds, couldn't speak. When I told my ex-boyfriend, he didn't want to be friends with me anymore. He just said, I'm so done. He got rejected by his old girlfriend, so I could understand. 

Valentine's day. My three year anniversary with Phil. Three years ago, we went to California pizza kitchen. Outside CPK, I waited. I appeared an hour too early, didn't want the day to end. Shaking in my boots. 
Things were so different back then. We both had been very afraid of each other, so we studied up on topics each other liked. When I first saw Phil he looked very handsome, and very young. Everything I remembered, I almost 
forgot to say, but I couldn't stop myself from talking. When I finally stopped talking, he looked at me. Then I asked him questions about himself, and what he liked. I asked him where he would want to travel, and what he thought
about multiple articles online. We had become friends in the same manner, but I wanted more, and it seemed so much more embarrassing back then.  I wished he had reciprocated the same interest in me, but he had trouble
speaking, so I understood. The servers came by and one of them asked us what we wanted. Phil asked me if there was anything I wanted, and he would pay for it. It was very sweet. From his perspective, he seemed pretty low emotion, 
but one could tell that he had tried as well. I wore a blue dress, with earrings and makeup. He wore a light tan shirt under a dark green jacket and jeans, which complemented his eyes. He seemed genuinely interested in what I had to say, as if he was listening to my 
soul. And it felt the same way for me, as if I was speaking and seeing the person underneath, despite the fact that it was hard to talk. 
Two hours passed by fast. Almost too fast. All of a sudden it was 7, and Phil got up to start going. It was like he was waiting for me to stop talking and he wanted to leave at the same time. I said, "I was wondering if we can do this again, is it possible?". That night I got
a very long text of how to do it again, which was one of the nicest things I have ever seen anyone do. He said, let's keep dating, do things together, and eventually we would end up together. He said that it seemed very possible to happen, and that for him, feelings grew
over time. 

He kissed me a month later, the night of a Bible study. Monday night, almost three to four weeks later. We were in a car. 
It took around a month to get him to invite me home. First we dated for the next few weeks. Then one day, Phil invited me over. It was the day of my birthday, and his family was out of town.
Now to look back on that journey was like looking through a mirror of regret and no regrets. I saw the good that we had done, but I could also see the bad in both of us. Both of us were cowardly. Phil was cowardly in his own way, he was afraid to talk to people unless
he felt his life wasn't a mess (and because it usually was a mess, he rarely talked.)

Swallowing our pride. Today we had to stay late at work, and it was hard getting all the expenses at once, the church added expenses, and so did my car breaking down. On top of that I had gotten kicked out of the children's ministry on the accounts that I needed to learn
how to raise a kid, and the other said it's more important for them to take care of the children than to teach me anything. They said this is not the time and the place for that. However, my own mother had gotten kicked out years ago.

I wanted to say:
First, I need to explain a big problem occurring in churches. I understand that the children come first, and personally I would rather speak in person than explain all of this via email, but this is very important. I was feeling sick that day as well, minor headache and my eyes were really sore.

However, people like the team here treated my mother like she was foreign, tried to get rid of her from school areas, and pushed her away from churches years ago when she was trying to make friends and know about the culture. Today these people are treating me in a similar manner, and I say this She was Indian from India, so she was Hindu and she was pushed away from God because of their actions. As a Christian right now this should never happen. If I believe in God I would not push away someone who isn’t Christian and who is a mother, because it affects the future generations. If they had welcomed her things may be different, however things also may not have been different as well. She also ended up raising us badly due to neglect and there became this cycle of victim and abuser, because we didn’t get to know God as a child. My father wasn’t around due to work as well.

Today, this team needs to consider the people who are going to be future parents (not necessarily the ones that are not). Some of these women here are free to volunteer at the food pantry or other areas because they aren’t in a position where they will need to take care of a kid in the future. Christ didn’t leave one person behind. Vina if you are reading this not all Christian people are fake. Some are but not everyone is, and God didn’t want us to be fake but rather to be a real community. People like these need to start putting Gods will in first before their own.

I am not willing to continue this cycle of victim and abuser any longer. I don’t even want kids, but unlike some others am getting married and am in a situation where something could possibly happen and I could end up having kids. 

However this type of issue should never ever happen in a church, especially among a group of believers,
 Thank you and have a good day,
 Haley

But instead the conversation went: You weren't around kids very often, etc. etc, you may fit in somewhere else. 
And instead I mentioned my mother, though I was a bit upset, I didn't say anything. I didn't want to upset God in any way, like I had been trying to change. But perhaps it was because I wasn't thinking about the children,
that it would be hard to give me any place there. And they would be correct, at least in part. However, there was also the possibility that someone with children would learn (or would like to learn), and as nobody factors
that into account, that also makes it really hard. So who would be responsible for such an issue.
I cannot stop what happened in the past, I can only change whatever I could now, in the present moment. I couldn't stop my mother leaving Christ, I couldn't stop people who died of overdoses, I could help their families, invite them
to our wedding, add a fundraiser part to the wedding, but I couldn't do anything except for change myself. And it was always going to be like this. It was always that we would have the choice to forgive, for ourselves. 

Betsy was right, the smartest thing to do when someone gives us criticism, is to examine why the criticism exists, and whether we should take it in, and analyze it, or let them be a hater. Usually haters just say things because they want to be heard,
or they don't feel important. And if we, ourselves, were acting like a hater, we would just criticize and not take into account producing our own stuff in life. We need to have our own thoughts, and produce our own ideas, as well. We can't just be 
stuck in the mud about someone else, always looking to the bad, and the ugly. For example, making a list of the things we are thankful about could stop this type of thinking. But in particular, in that particular situation when we are stuck in our own heads and 
we feel like we cannot get out, we see traps everywhere, and it's hard to look forward to the future, and what it holds. If I truly looked at myself, and found that things would be possible in the future, I wouldn't be so afraid what tomorrow may bring. And the same stands for 
everything. Ironically, the same stands for the government as well, people shouldn't take everything today as if it was forever. When the pandemic first started, everyone began to freak out and think it was the end of the world. They watched the news, worried about every little thing, and followed everything 
the government said. If America had taken things with more patience, we could have worn masks and waited for a vaccine. But too much was unknown during the time, so people felt their lives out of control. And Betsy described the same. She said that people don't want their
lives to be out of control.

Betsy, in her own life, had some sense of a loss of control, and a want to make things happen. She had to take care of her grandkids, the same day that she was preparing to have bible study with the other women, and planning to open her home to them. Betsy was older,
with 5 children, and grandchildren. In addition, I had seen her volunteer before at Churches, and she had a job at a school as well. With that many responsibilities, how did she have time to do other things. Just this week, I had seen how hard it was to take responsibility 
for my own life, and for things going on. I had to plan a wedding (but most of it was taken care of by the website and by the venue). I had to meet a lot of friends, family, and pay part of my money for the venue. And if my life was this hard, how much harder would I feel to have the same
responsibilities as someone like Betsy! But she said that all things are made possible by God. Nothing was out of His hands. 

Today going back to work as well. Last night was a release and we got out late. I started worrying about having kids again. Today we are supposed to go hiking, and hopefully it will go better than last week. We watched a new show called Reacher, about 
Jack Reacher and the cops. I really like cop shows, so this was going well. In addition to the other shows I like watching like Riverdale, Scream, and a few animes as well. One of the first animes Phil and I watched was full metal panic, done many years in the past, this show was
about a young man who is a child soldier for Mithril (an organization). He ends up falling in love with a high school girl, as they are both 16, and she has special abilities with technology. He does as well, as he is able to pilot large armed robots. There is three seasons, with
him going to her school, her going into the military world, and then both of them chasing each other after. The show was first introduced to me by Phil and it was really good. That was our all time favorite show. In addition,
we watched multiple. After that we went hiking with our friend Camelia at night. Silverado was so different at night, everything looked really nice! It had been so different than during the day, where I had felt a lethargy I hadn't felt before, like my 
entire body hurt. It could also be the fact that the amount I had consumed up to seven meals that day, including a lot of snacks. Ironically, I would probably pay for that the next day.

Today we went to hang out with Wally. He wanted to come over, and then Phil let him come over. First Wally drove to us, then he asked to go to lunch, and we had snacks. He used to live at OCC's dorms, and Wally is a college student, so he is 
somewhat indecisive, but really nice. However, he had like two addictions: cigarettes and drinking. We should have perhaps taken Wally to the beach instead, because there was many more young people around there, or in Irvine. Maybe it's because several of them stay 
indoors, or go to places like the Spectrum, hiking, or the malls around here, I don't think several of them stay at home. 
At first we went to El Torito, and then he looked around. El Torito was really expensive, so we went to Wahoo's fish tacos. Then we came back, played Mario brothers, and hung out. Phil drank his first beer, and Wally had 1 and 1/2 beers. I had at least 3 cookies, 1 small pack,
and chocolate chip cookies. Eventually we went for ice cream at Handel's ice cream, and that was fun too! I was a little surprised with all of these events popping, but in some ways, I think it's common before any wedding. Some people want to have bachelor parties, or bachlorette parties.
Some don't. It would be what it would be.

Wally also mentioned segregation, when he came to visit the area we were in. My brother had spoke of the same years ago, and I had heard people in the past mention segregation, and segregation, in it's more aggressive form, isn't seen today. In the past,
segregation had been, dark skinned people in one area, and worse off then light skinned people. However, segregation was outlawed, along with it's various forms. What is seen today is more of a form of 
stereotyping people. It occurs on TV, where people tend to marry others or date others of a similar culture or mindset. It also occurs in neighborhoods, because people tend to like comfort. Segregation tends to happen because people tend to like comfort,
and part of comfort is feeling a sense of belonging. So having the same values around a person that they believed as a child, brings us the most amount of comfort. The previous generation tends to criticize millenials for being too soft, and millenials tend to 
criticize the past generation for having too many traditions, and having life easier due to less people. Ironically, these also, can be stereotypes, because many millenials are hard-working and traditional, while the previous generation did have people who
were less traditional. For some reason, that particular morning  I was feeling a lethargy I hadn't felt before, but also a particular anger toward myself, as if I couldn't move my hands and feet. I watched Cuphead in bed (there is a new show on that, based off
of the old video game). We also watched Love is Blind. Love is Blind featured a few couples who had never seen each other before, but the people found themselves attracted to each other based off of the way they spoke. Ironically, despite the fact that 
people hadn't seen each other, they tended to match up to the people that were most similar to them, and that also looked somewhat similar to them. 

Segregation worried me, especially if it had been happening now. In the media, people talked about discrimination, and some people wondered about that too. A lot of people in different areas had help from their parents, but since my family was mostly foreign, 
(even our real grandmother on my father's side - who was an immigrant), I worried that I may not have the chance to fit my culture into the American one. On the other hand, I am getting married in an American way, partly due to the fact that I didn't want too
much argument, despite the fact that I wanted to elope, or run away and be somewhere where culture or tradition didn't define a person. It would be easier to have a place where the work people did, or their actions, would define how a person was seen. If they weren't 
seen for the color of their hair, skin, type of hair, skin, or eyes or anything would be nice. Sometimes, this keeps me from going outside. I stay inside and work, and sometimes go places (outdoors). I also worry that money discrimination makes us the type of 
person we are today. It just didn't seem right to add more differences to each person, but rather for everyone to see past culture, tradition, segregation, or skin, and to look for the person underneath, the person that had choices. 

Today, Phil and I planned for the future. It was President's day, so we got time off, and we talked to each other about life in general. With the upcoming wedding, there was something to prove. Sometimes, I wondered if this would be some kind of sick joke, that 
I wouldn't be able to get married because of something bad happening, like someone dying, or losing their job, or life being too good to be true. In some ways, thinking about that allowed us to become bitter and angry. I am not sure why the feeling was dulled on this
particular day, maybe it was because I had stopped putting such big expectations on the wedding. Now I felt like I was paying for everything in general. Paying to meet friends, paying to have a stable life (so that I wouldn't be hurt), and paying for everything
by working and living life. Ironically, it feels like throwing our life away, because we are having to put in so much effort for so little payout. Last night, however, I saw how wise the older ladies had been. They realized that life wasn't about divisions, rather
we are all one people (humans are just human after all). No amount of arguments are going to change that, and all humans are mortal. Mortals need God. Maybe because our pride gets in the way, maybe it seems futile, but it isn't. But life itself (the day to day), 
especially any efforts we had to put into hanging out with anyone, was very dull, bland, and almost annoying to have to go through such lengths of effort just to be stable. I know, this sounds really mean to say, but it just seems so true.
I mean, half my friends didn't have as much effort, their parents or someone else would take it from them, and I wanted to be like that, to have stuff taken care of for me.
 In addition, the other half of our friends had a very ill view of life, that the rich get richer, and it wasn't worth it to try anything. But if we don't try, then how will we show love to others?

Today, I had a hard time during the night sleeping. Partly because there was a missing girl on a lot of people's posts. Apparently, she had gone missing from a local city, Ladera Ranch, during a cheer contest in Las Vegas, Nevada. Las Vegas is more of a place for tourists
and gambling than for cheer contests, but sometimes they did happen there. Many years ago, one of my childhood classmates died in Lake Forest, and they had a search for him. Ironically, while not having as much sympathy for the girl in question, I felt bad for her parents
and in some ways, worse about myself for not feeling as bad. I just couldn't relate, and it was hard to. But in the end of the day, each person makes their own choice to choose love for themselves. The ill in my heart had more pity for myself, and then I felt disgusted by myself
for feeling those thoughts, as if I was better than someone else. In some ways, while I had gotten punished for saying something that was the right thing to do, imagine how much worse it would be to be injured or killed for just existing.

There was a case like that. Gabriel Fernandez, the boy who got beat by his mother and her boyfriend, and died at age 8. The trial was heartbreaking. Everyone could see that the woman and her husband didn't care at all for him. He had bruises everywhere, and marks everywhere.
How could something like that ever happen? There had been people, also, who had seen abuse happen, and nobody said anything, or did anything. 

Today I heard a podcast on Friendship or Flirtation. It was pretty good, they showed the warning signs of how someone could start an affair and a few things that were interesting were the choices that people made under stress. Affairs have been caused (according to the speaker)
Dave Carder, by people who are under stress, and often fantasize about a different life with a new person. Infatuation is a chemical in the brain that causes attraction (especially that occur between platonic friendships). In addition, the dangers of an affair, especially
ones that start emotionally (because - for everyone - affairs involve emotion). I know because, when I have seen affairs happen, in life, it has had more to do with emotions. When someone compliments someone else, instead of criticizes them, it raises their spirits. 
Sometimes, however, we don't complement, instead criticize because we feel bad about ourselves. Sometimes, we criticize because we are angry about things happening to us. And sometimes, we criticize for honest reasons, that we see that they would be better off if they
took our advice. When someone is married, they can tend to project many emotions and issues onto their spouses, and that would cause a bad marriage. Men think in solutions, women think in emotions in some ways. All people have emotions, and want emotional connection at some level (because we were created that way). How true this was,
it was so much easier to think of getting married to someone rich or powerful or handsome, rather than the person that was with me, and we weren't even married! And it had nothing to do with Phil (because he is an amazing person), I was just worried about losing my life
and becoming older too fast!

In some ways, I do have a legitimate criticism. The melatonin in our skin (pigment) would cause us to look older than our pale counterpart. Stress also, from taking a job that required stress, or living a life worried, would age us faster than the average person. 

All this tradition is getting harder for me to live. It was hard to do everything, especially all the tradition. Today we couldn't just get married in the courthouse, we had to get a marriage license. In order to get that, we had to do an interview, and I took the interview
with Phil. Then they couldn't tell us when the certificate would come in, so Phil had to drive in before the wedding, just in order to get it on time. It felt like they were forcing traditions on us to add more pressure, or because they had done it for their entire
lives, and it was easy for them just to follow their own traditions. A lot of those other women had other issues too, they go to church, juggled many tasks, and other issues like having trouble sleeping. Personally, I have trouble sleeping a lot when I think of pressure,
and when I think about everyone asking me to meet them, or to get help. All the time. And right now, it seemed harder than ever. Also maybe it's that Phil gets defensive every time someone similar to him gets insulted. And he needs to stop that, because if I am going 
to be married to him I need to be right after God in his relationships. It should be God, himself, and then me, not someone who looks like him or who acts like him. Not even someone who works hard. His traditions and his life should be caring for me and himself. 
That is the way for one to be married to another. 

Today, woke up feeling a little better (it was less cold during the night). I'm still a little worried because my stomach hurts a bit, but other than that, I think everything should be ok. Our wedding is in one week. The traditions are Lantern festival today with the 
girls, Bridal shower tomorrow, Monday night was the Women's Bible study and leaving the dress there. Friday was a dinner in El Torito's, 1 mile from my father, so he had no excuse to leave. My father was the only one of my family joining, because I don't have much 
family around here. I have only parents and one brother. My brother was staying at UCR for finals, and my mom in Virginia. Riley, I could understand. He said, why did you place the wedding on that week, and we said we didn't know. I could also understand because 
he was still young, and a little bit of a naive person. I could also understand because of finals, and finals take a lot out of college students. They try their best but they don't know that the real world has a lot more to offer. In some ways, college life doesn't 
matter after people start working, but some people still like that first taste of independence. For my mother, her reason was covid, and being afraid to fly. A few other people said similar things about travel, but all of Phil's aunts and uncles decided to fly out 
to the wedding, so I was more surprised by my mother.

Even despite all this, I am still worried about being married. Phil and I have been together for 3 years now, and we have known each other for around 4 years (we went to the same church service before covid hit). In addition, I went to UCI with Phil's brother, and did 
a similar subject. From when I first spoke to Phil, till today we had grown a lot. We changed as people, and grew into our older selves. It was surprising, but it was also really fun to become our adult selves. I had seen Phil take more responsibility as he grew older,
when I first met him, he was 26 (still living with his family) and a little bit immature. I was 21 and I was very immature. I didn't know what real life was like, barely had any friends, and drove to a lot of places. I also spent money on stupid things, and acted a little bit
like I didn't care about anything. I think a lot of young adults have this problem nowadays. Last night was the bridal shower, and it was really fun! 
Camelia is one of the nicest people I have ever seen. She and another friend, Gohar, sang together the song from the titanic, as well as a few others. In addition, I have never seen someone with as much talent as she does. For opera, her voice is really, really good. 

Today was terribly annoying. I came to work, and it was like the sales people had bailed. Then we couldn't do almost anything because we were having issues with code coverage, and it turns out, a lot of the code was unused or had issues. So there has been a rift between the developers and the sales/project
managers, and today was no exception. That's one of the reasons I dislike that lady in the Bible study that also works in technical sales. Because they don't understand how hard the devs and the QA people work. 

Today was the worst, in the morning my period hit, exactly 5 days before our wedding. Meaning on the wedding night, we couldn't do anything except watch TV. At least we hadn't thrown up on the isle, that would be worse. I did throw up inside today, however. In addition,
due to stress, I woke up in the middle of the night, yet again, in a strange fashion. Then I couldn't get out of bed, because it was so cold outside. Everything hurt like the dickens, and during the day, everything seemed fine. The weather did ups and downs really fast.
I ate ice cream during the day, so I wasn't able to eat it at night. On the bright side, there is only two days of wedding traditions before it's all over, so I just have to be patient. Just as bad the next day, and worse, we just found out that one of our friends, the dev boss's wife had passed away.
Ironically, I felt his pain, Christ said to mourn with those who mourned. The women in the Bible Study refuse to take it seriously, sometimes they send memes and say they are praying for each other. But death is sad, regardless of whether the person is a believer or not.
It should be ok to say that people feel pain, and it should be normal to show that pain. In addition, the fear made me hate my enemies worse (or maybe it was the enemies in my head). I wished I could tell those women that the people I disliked I wished got hurt badly. Like the women who have 
big homes, and nice things because their husbands take care of them, especially the pale ones. I hated them because they were considered beautiful, and I wasn't as much. So in some ways, I fight myself not to say these things to them. 

I wonder why they even bother to try sometimes. They will get older, and beauty tends to fade as time goes on. But I don't know if I should hurt them by saying it honestly. Someday, my beauty will fade too, I'm not immune to anything they aren't immune to. But for me, personally, I didn't see things as beautiful or not 
becautiful. My mother was in the hospital for a few days due to diabetes; she had high blood sugar. She knew that beauty was focused from the heart, not from the exterior. Yet I have seen people who tend to focus on the exterior as well. 

I am worried we will have to go back into work full time. Despite the fact that due to covid, around 2 years made it so that we could work partly from home, I'm about to be married. In addition, everything is about to open back up again, and I'm really worried. Some part of me liked the two years 
of work from home, and work in person. At home, I could take breaks, and didn't have to worry too much about anyone seeing me. At this point, I didn't know if I would be able to go back and have people see me. I liked going in on days we get donuts, but I didn't like a lot of change 
at once, and people seem to keep adding changes in this world. It hurts when someone dies, or when something bad happens. It hurts when things change. Even though we are a few days before the wedding, the worry is still real. I can't change who I am.
I found the root cause of my anger. Not that it's of any importance, as the Bible says anyway not to worry about searching one's own heart, because God already knows our feelings, emotions, and thoughts. I wanted to be with Phil earlier, and marry Phil in secret a few years ago. 
Then, in some ways I did want a real wedding, but I wanted it on my own terms,
when I was around 27, had my family there like my brother and mother and other members, and I wanted my own place and success before I even got married. I wanted to be somebody, not just a nobody, or just being defined by the person I was married to. In a way, Phil had what I wanted
to have all along, a family that supported me, but the problem was that it was his life and not mine. I wanted my own life.

So it wasn't surprising that when everyone tries to force things on us, even giving us gifts, it's not surprising when we rebel. God didn't want that for our lives, he wanted us to be free to choose, so he didn't stay and watch us and force us to do things.
However, I have to take responsibility for the fact that I agreed to do this wedding. If I had said no and waited for everything to be relatively equal, for us to have our own jobs, cars, homes, vacations, and everything duplicated (twice), then maybe things
would have been a more even playing field. I would prefer to have things be more even, not as uneven as they are now. However, I knew I didn't really have a choice, after I had agreed, it wouldn't be wise to say no. I didn't want to keep changing my mind, so if it was 
to be at this stage, then it will be what it will be. But this isn't what I wanted for my life. Hopefully someday, I will be more successful, in every way. 

Today is the night before the wedding.  Tomorrow is literally our wedding. We had a rehersal, and we followed the vows. In fact, we have to go to Phil's family at night for dinner at around 6. I'm terrified, as I am afraid that they will end up talking to me too much, and also they
invited my father as well. Phil has a lot of people coming tonight (luckily it is less tonight for us). Also, we had to follow the rehersal steps, and when we said the vows, Phil looked me in the eyes and said it. He's still kinda nervous, but he said it with tears in his
eyes so I think he likes me as well. I really do love Phil, as he is very sweet. However, ironically, at the moment, I felt more of an attraction to the pastor, and Phil's brother. But it's more of a nervous issue than anything. There's a war in Ukraine created by Russia, after
Putin decided to invade Ukraine. Camelia, our opera singer friend, is going to sing, and Pauline is writing a speech for the toast, as well. Ironically, I liked the gifts, but I wish that I would just be a particpant. It was hard to sleep the last few nights, and my head 
hurts really badly, and I also need to show love, rather than to just feel love. To show love, I would try to talk about them, listen to the people, and offer kind advice or remarks. Instead of being passive aggressive, I will try to be slow to be defensive. I think that will be best.
Phil's grandparents themselves are really nice, but I am very nervous because the other parts of his family are new to me, and my eyes and head hurts a little bit. 

Today is the big wedding. We go in at 8 in the morning. After the wedding, we will be free to do whatever we want, and our first night of having sex. That part is a bit nervous, but I'm really excited to be married to Phil. 
During the wedding, it was really fun. Everyone sat there, and Phil's sister hosted the reception and activities. Ironically, during the middle, my mom gave us a cancer scare. She was told she had cancer and it was travelling and Stage 4. The doctors
worried us badly, then she went to get a second opinion. Then she got a second opinion, to wait for the biopsy. They said it may even be benign. I think that it was God's way of changing us. I tried to change after that, because I didn't want to live that kind of life.
I started exercising, and stopped feeling sorry for myself as much, even though my eyes hurt. I was happy that I wasn't alone in feeling pain, but also upset that my mom wasn't saved. She got mad at me multiple times the day after. I didn't even have enough time
to notice that I was married, and that these things had happened. Today, even, my head hurt and it was hard to go back to work. I also feel some pain in my side too, thinking about all of these issues. She's been in the hospital for around 10 days now, and is going
to have a bad medical bill, either way. I think it was God's way of showing that faith, family, and community was more important than even success, financially, or in beauty and power.

My mom has cancer. It's pancreatic cancer, and it is survivable. For the past few days, I have cried beacuse I worried about her dying. But lucky it was caught in an early enough stage. She's still at the Inova hospital in Alexandria, VA.
And however, I understood that I had problems as well, but nowhere near as bad as her. In some ways, I think God was teaching us all a lesson, that we needed to have faith, family and friends. By keeping ourselves inside, when we need 
help nobody is there to help us. Today I also have a doctor appointment, had to go shopping earlier, and have to go to an exercise class after work. I am a little nervous with all the activities. Earlier I had laready vaccumed
and cleaned the laundry. Most of today has been multitasking because I added everything to one day of the week. In addition, a lot of the food had been used over the last few weeks and earlier due to wedding issues.
So far juggling all the tasks wasn't easy. I heard from mothers and grandmothers that tasks only grow worse, due to taking care of kids as well. Ironically, the birth control pills we worried about only had the same 
headaches and nausea, and other issues that I had experienced normally.

Also, we had to eat healthier due to our mother being in a cancer hospital. That wasn't the only hard thing, or the thing that needed change. A lot needed change. My mom's surgery is on Friday, and today is Thursday. Also I 
had to face the fact that if I hadn't sold her land around a year ago, she would have more money to pay for her cancer. In addition, when I offered to give her storage a place in the place I owned partly, Phil put up resistance.
Phil says he wants it as only temporary. But for her, cancer isn't temporary. It isn't temporary for anyone, she will continue to need chemotherapy and other treatments, to reduce the size of the tumor. Even though she was able to 
catch it early, we needed to get a treatment for her just in case. I was really sad, and half the people don't understand my pain. My mom isn't the nicest to me, but I still don't want her to die. I really want her to live, and 
obviously, she wants to live. I also wanted to be able to help her in some way. But when I told my dad, he said to wait. Exactly as Phil said. Phil also said that he wants to wait and check on the situation before he does something drastic.
It's the way Phil always is, he always waits for everything. And now, as he is my husband, I need to listen to him. Luckily we still have a month before we need to move everything back. 

The second sunday after I am married. Married life isn't what I thought it would be like. Part of it is because my mom has cancer, so I feel very sad. Another part is that I need to stop disrespecting Phillip. Yesterday night,
we watched a Home Improvement episode where Tim insulted his wife's drooling in the middle of the night. Today, I feel the same way as well, and so I said Phil is a joke according to income. His job has been the same for a few years, and 
he makes only a little bit more than a worker at McDonalds or Panda Express, which is slightly ironic because he went to college for 5 years (3 years before transferring from Community College). Despite his lack of ambition, Phil is still
a really great guy. But with my mom telling me one day she's going to die soon in a few months, and one day telling me she's going to live and have surgery, I didn't know what to think. Sometimes, I know it's because she, herself,
doesn't know what to think. People tell me she is scared, but I didn't know much because she lives in Virginia. I also don't know how to run gofundme, but I set one up for her as well. The last I can remember is the doctor telling
me that she had cancer in the pancreas, and my father says that she has cancer also. In addition, my eyes and hormones have made it hard for me to think. I've had days of headaches, for no reason at all, just random mood swings.

Today, I also went to church as well, for the first time in person in weeks. We sat outside, and the air breezed along our face. Today was an interesting topic, living in light and in darkness. In darkness, all we can do is feel
angry, or unemotional, and we only worry about ourselves. In light, we want to share, and help others grow by encouraging them. Light comes from God, and is shown by love, true unconditional love for another. In light, I feel less pain,
but in darkness, there is always greed, or anger, or shame about the emotions we have. In darkness, we make decisions based off of ourselves. Sometimes, in darkness, I felt happy that there was someone who was suffering as much as I. After all,
I have eye pain every few days from trouble sleeping and headaches, also caused by weather and other factors. I wished sometimes, that I wasn't alone in having this pain as well. I know some of it is self-caused, but some parts hurt pretty bad.
All I know for sure is, it only gets worse if we worry about it, or if the weather keeps changing (hot to cold or rain to sun). And some of it, we have no choice or control over. 

A few days later. I am almost angry at everyone and everything. My mother refuses to work with my father. She refused to come to California, and nobody is telling us anything, other than the fact that she wants my father to pay for her
stuff. It always seems that way, she doesn't want to see us ever, but she wants us to do stuff for her. She literally had 2 million dollars worth of investments, and she never let us touch any of it, including my father, who actually made 
part of the bills for her to even make those investments. She would make it so that my father wouldn't be able to take care of himself, especially if he had cancer. It was so unfair, so of course, I felt upset. My father had tried to help her to her every whim, he offered
to take a loan a few years ago to help her set up her businesses, he paid for her place, the only thing he didn't do was pay as much attention to her as she wanted. Sometimes, I wonder why he did everything for her, when she
could have done some of those things herself. I thought cancer is supposed to make people want to be closer to their family and their loved ones, that in the stress, they would figure out working together is what matters most. But it hurts when
they don't work together, because working together helps everyone. It was part of God's plan. 

I keep trying to ask her, do you want us to join development, do you need us to help you? I wish I will get an answer. She told us a little bit more today, but I am still unclear about some things. 
Today was much harder than the last few days. Leslie, my friend, got hacked and now she was minus a few thousand dollars, so she started a gofundme to help her as well. Leslie has had life hard for a while, she has family that was in the Phillipines. In addition, 
her father was also abusive, so that put a bit of strain on her, as well.  Also, my mom has a few issues as well, so I had to start a gofundme for her, especially for 
pancreatic cancer, which is a tough cancer. In addition, some of our friends at work included Sam in a chat, so now we can all talk to each other. Sam's a pretty cool kid, he came to our wedding, but he's a bit younger than me, Jan, Amy and William, the other
people our age at work. So far work has been ok, except when they are doing releases, then it seems to be everyone has to work extra hard. The devs have it harder than us also. They have to fix the errors when the errors come up, however, they 
should know the code better than we do. Ironically, because we have a better test environment than the dev local machine, the QAs have caught a few errors. 

On a different topic, the women in the mornings get pampered by mom classes. Ironically, I still find myself looking, when I'm bored. Maybe it's because I know I will not be able to sustain a child, or the possibility of having a child and raising them well is quite low.
It's quite unfair (lol to be honest). They get nicer snacks, in person lessons, etc, wheras the working people get night lessons (which are a bit harder, worse quality of snacks, whatever
the people make). I also know that I wouldn't be a good parent because I am somewhat irresponsible. A lot of people are irresponsible, and the amount of responsibility a child adds on is a lot.
Not that any of that is important, I think. Today's the final day of my barre3 classes. The owner had her fiancee die 6 months ago, and now she is no longer able to keep the studio (I guess negotiations between them and the landlord)
so they ended up closing down. The other two barre studios stayed open, and the final classes are on 3/31. I had to use the last of my classes this month due to that issue. It sucks for her though, but I always remember, everything is on loan to everyone, nothing is permanent.
Sucks that it has to happen to ordinary people though. I talked to one of the management guys today, he was really nice, he buys us donuts every week. He said go to see your mom, and maybe see the capital of the US as well, which would be cool. 

Sometimes it feels like life just goes from one downhill issue to another. First my car breaks down, then I have trouble sleeping. I get married, get in fights with Phil after getting married because last night, Phil said he would be better off on his own. In some 
ways, I wouldn't do anything unless I was pushed to do it. Also my mom got cancer. Yesterday, I drove to Ladera Ranch, and their plazas are nice, like really nice. After wondering if we could live there, it ended up that we couldn't because everything was too
expensive for us and not worth it. I already have enough trouble trying to live, I didn't want to add any extra work onto myself. On top of all that, Phil refuses to get a roommate. Turns out also my cadillac converter got stolen from the prius outside.
It was an old prius, but this has been the second time someone has taken parts of it to sell. I hate when this type of thing tends to happen, I always seem to lose something, and then bad events all fall in a line. Sometimes good events all fall into a line, like the 
wedding and gifts all came at once, but then bad events as well tend to fall into a line (first one, then another, etc.) until it all tends to happen over and over. I know why though, we are near a big freeway, first street so there's an easy exit. It's the same
way for my father, who is also in a similar type of area.
